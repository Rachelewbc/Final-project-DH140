# Final-project-DH140
For the final project, I created a network visualization based on the memoir of a Buddhist scholar called Ruth Strout McCandless. The memoir's title is " Kangetsu: Memoirs of Ruth Strout McCandless April, 1944." The memoir is in box 2, folder 2 of a collection called McCandless (Ruth S.) Collection on Nyogen Senzaki. The collection is in  UCLA's Charles E. Young Research Library Special Collections. (https://oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/c8wh2vs5/)

Here is the process of creating the network analysis. 
1. I used the English transformer pipeline in Spacy to find name entities. 
2. I created an Excel sheet with all variations of names in one column and full names of characters in another.
3. I converted the memoir's text into PDF format, deleted all the unnecessary punctuation and line breaks, and replaced all variations of names with full names.
4. I created a node and edge table of connections between characters in the text and a network visualization of recognized people. Finally, I categorized them into different colors based on their area of expertise.
