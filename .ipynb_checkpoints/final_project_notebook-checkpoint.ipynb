    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The project focuses on an unpublished memoir titled \"Kangetsu: The Memoirs of Ruth Strout McCandless As Told to Günther Cologna in April 1994.\"  The memoir is a part of the Ruth Strout McCandless Collection on Nyogen Senzaki, housed at UCLA's East Asian library. This collection, introduced to me by my supervisor Dr. Jesse Drian, contains the memoir, which includes transcripts of eight tapes, recounts Ruth McCandless's life, particularly her involvement with Zen Buddhism. Throughout the memoir, she details interactions with prominent Zen Buddhists such as Nyogen Senzaki, Soen Nakagawa, Soyen Shaku, Eido Tai Shimano, and D. T. Suzuki. Additionally, she was involved with influential Indian philosophers like Vanda Scaravelli, Jiddu Krishnamurti, and Selvarajan Yesudian, as well as notable figures in the writing and creative industry such as Anne Lindbergh, Harriet Doerr, Wallace Stegner, and Peter Matthiessen. The memoir also touches on her connections with spiritualists like Carolyn Conger and Brian Weiss. In addition to the educators from Stanford University, including Edith R. Mirrielees, Anthony Sokol, and Wilfred Stone.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the numerous characters that appear in the memoir, it became evident that a network analysis would be beneficial to understand Ruth McCandless's interactions and contributions to various fields, particularly Zen Buddhism in mid-20th century America. By creating a network analysis, I aim to highlight her unique position as a female Buddhist scholar and elucidate the prominent figures in the development of Zen Buddhism in the United States. Additionally, the network analysis can illustrate the connections between individuals interested in Buddhism and those in the creative industry, offering a comprehensive view of the social landscape of an upper-class white female Buddhist scholar based in California during the twentieth century.\n",
    "\n",
    "The memoir includes both famous and non-famous individuals, but for privacy reasons, only recognized figures were included in the network analysis. Despite the chronological order of the interview questions, a thorough reading revealed that the characters could be grouped into professions such as Indian Buddhist practitioner, Japanese Buddhist practitioner, creator, spiritualist, educator, and organizational personnel. Creator were further divided into writer, actress, film producer, and publisher. \n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to illuminate Ruth McCandless' significant contributions and connections within the realms of Zen Buddhism, Indian philosophy, and the creative industry through a comprehensive network analysis."

    "# Methods\n",
    "## Data Preparation\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Text Extraction and Cleaning:\n",
    "   - I began by converting an OCR-scanned document to a text format and saved it as \"original copy 2.txt.\" This document contained the memoirs of Ruth Strout McCandless.\n",
    "   - To identify named entities within the text, I utilized spaCy, an NLP library. I experimented with different pipelines: the medium-size pipeline (en_core_web_md), large-size pipeline (en_core_web_lg), and transformer pipeline (en_core_web_trf). I found that the results were almost the same across these pipelines.\n",
    "   - I combined the named entity recognition (NER) results from these pipelines. I identified both famous and non-famous individuals mentioned in the memoir. For this project, I only focused on famous individuals. I created an Excel file named \"Noa_Names.xlsx,\" which includes famous individuals. I compiled all variations of their names found in the NER process into one column “Name in NER” separated by commas, and included their full names in another column “Full name”.\n"

      "  This was in Japan I think about 196465 and Senzaki Sensei had not been back to Japan since he had left it early in the century to follow Shaku Soen and Daisetsu Teitaro Suzuki to the United States It was a beautiful beautiful day a Japanese day I would say There was a very gentle shiguritype rain and little diamond raindrops would come down the fetch of the monastery There was also some sort of celebration I dont know which one possibly of Buddhas birthday Roshi abbots priests of Zen had gathered from all over Japan and were there in their magnificent brocade robes in this gray gentle quiet atmosphere and I remember watching them file into the main building and after they were in Senzaki Sensei and I went in There were a lot of little lacquered tables around on the floor The people there were all seated on the floor I remember the monks in their black robes hurrying around to serve various guests That was my introduction to Japan Asahina Roshi was the roshi at the time and before I left Japan  in fact just the day before  I went to have tea with him at Engakuji and something ineffable took place at that time which has always meant a great deal to me I dont know what it was I just know that I happened to look up  I was sitting next to him  I happened to look up just as he turned to look at me and it was just a flash an instant of an amazing contact The next night when I was at the Haneda Airport to come home and it was midnight he was there with Soen Roshi to see me off I was not surprised about Soen Roshi for after all Id been at Ryutakuji for five months but I was a bit surprised about Asahina Roshi Soen Roshi said Why dont you stay I said I have a home and a family to go back to So I couldnt stay This must have been in 55 though because Senzaki Sensei died in 1958 Youre right I remember I was traveling through Southern France with John we were near Florac or some such place and all of a sudden I knew  and I hadnt even been thinking about Senzaki Sensei  I knew he was gone   After he was gone did you ever have the impression  did you ever feel his presence or did he ever appear in your dreams The reason Im hesitating is that there certainly are people who have and Im trying to remember now because it happened quite a number of times with certain people before and since I truly dont remember I do remember one time being very surprised I was gathering something and I felt his hand touching my shoulder I turned and of course he wasnt there He had passed away    What are your earliest memories I do remember holding my mothers hand standing on a street corner when the fire engines went by they were horsedrawn and there was a Dalmatian sitting up between the two firemen in front I remember that very clearly It couldve happened last week easily but it didnt  Duncan showed me an article written by Eido Shimano in which he claims that he has the kesa and the robe of Senzakisan I guess Senzakisan just passed them around because I have one right over there in that cedar chest I showed Duncan my kesa which of course is the major passalong  mind you only a symbolical one you wouldnt get much rice in it the other is a magnificent brocade robe I never saw Senzakisan in it and Im inclined to think that it belonged to Senzakisans father the Tendai priest but I dont know It is beautiful and very ornate I know years ago when I was in Japan there was a gathering of priests from all over Japan to honor Gempo Roshi It was held at N agahama outside of Kochi I went there and stayed at a little ryokan A little mud road would go down to the temple I walked it down each day  it was about a mile  and all these little children were following me It was like a crocodile right behind me  all these cute little Japanese children I had come supplied with lots of Lifesavers and so the second day I made that walk and they were dancing along behind I stopped and opened up a package and passed them around The next day all their mothers with these white aprons were out and bowing to me as I went along At the ceremony the robes these various priests and roshi wore were simply magnificent I must also have some pictures that I took    You said after Senzaki Sensei came back from Heart Mountain he stayed with you in Pasadena Yes we had moved to Pasadena by that time and he stayed with us in our home for six weeks because a it was very difficult to find housing and b because during the war that strange fellow in the Oval Office had 50000 blacks sent to LA to Southern California and 50000 to Northern California Up to that time we had never had blacks here  I mean we had them they had come out with people as retainers and so forth and we had nothing against them  they were wonderful  but suddenly the flood And see the Japanese were gone and they just made ramshackles of Little Tokyo I remember I went down one day  I cant remember why but Im sure it was something in connection with Senzakisan  and I would see people stand at the curb and urinate Very different from when the Japanese were here Senzakisan had gone to Heart Mountain just about when Duncan was three months old and Keith was still a little fellow I would often write to him about them what Id be doing with them and so forth He cut out these parts edited them and put them all together and made a little booklet or magazine for young mothers up there  How did you meet Nyogen Senzaki When I was about in my early twenties I read Garden of Vision I loved it I went down to the Main County Library in Los Angeles in their Religions and Metaphysical Room to get some information on Zen  not a word So I continued what I had been doing which was mainly on my own meditating as I understood it Eventually I went to see a library which was owned and had been built by Manly P Hall who was an outstanding lecturer and philosopher in Los Angeles He came out one time to his library  people hadnt been using it much at the time and in order to get in I had to find the custodian who unlocked the door for me then he opened the glass cases along the wall and Id pull out the book I wanted So Mr Hall came out one day and I was seated at the big table reading one of Suzukis books Zen First Essays Series he sat down and we began to talk and he said that he thought that Zen would one day be very prominent in America It is an American kind of approach to life he said And bless his heart he said You may take that book home if you like to read it And so I did Then he also told me There is a man who lives in Los Angeles I dont think he said monk and you can go down and talk with him I thought about this for a long time because I was very deeply serious about it and I knew that once I got started I would not be turning back It was about a year before one beautiful January day I  walked from our home down to the train that would take me into Los Angeles  it was three miles  a beautiful walk beautiful day I got down to Little Tokyo and inquired at a bookstore where I could find Senzaki Sensei They directed me to Turner Street and I found there this rather grimy little Victorian house Across the front of it was a wistaria bush in full bloom I went up and knocked at the door  no answer Eventually I went down and around and up another set of steps knocked at the door and Hai I opened the door and inside was Senzaki Sensei sitting at a big kitchen table absolutely stacked with piles of books and these great big Christmas orhaments hanging from the ceiling by strings at different lengths When I asked him what they were for he answered Oh it keeps the flies away They see this big thing and they go away Maybe they did I told him that I was interested in Zen and he just shuffled through some papers pulled out a few and handed them to me saying You may have these Then he said Come on in well meditate He went into this tiny room I guess it was a living room put on his black robe over his civilian clothes and sat in front of his table  I hesitate to call it an altar  which had on it a picture I learned later was of Shaku Soen an incense stand a little bell with a fat cushion under it and that was about all We meditated for a few moments then I left and went home with these papers That night we had an earthquake and I thought this is really shaking things up    How did you learn to meditate Maybe I had found a reference in one of Manly P Halls books or one of his lectures but there certainly werent any directions No I just worked out my own system which was essentially quieting the brain but that was something I had already done as a child I remember very well lying in a haystack one time when I was probably ten years old I think lots of children do it naturally As a matter of fact have you ever heard anything of Brugh Joys  Yes I read Joys Way He says in there it doesnt matter which way you meditate you do it your own way  Earlier we talked about Senzakisans return from Heart Mountain How was he when he came back how had the experience in the camp affected him  Well if it affected him in any way it wasnt visible to me He looked the same he seemed the same He was uncomfortable being in our home when John would come home John was just furious that I had invited Senzaki Sensei He said Well dont let him do anything with Keith and Duncan I said Dont worry he wont So Senzaki was very uncomfortable It was very difficult to find a place for him The first place was pretty miserable it was downtown in Little Tokyo but anyway it gave him a room but no other facility I can remember Of course he never did have a kitchen he always went out for his meals I dont know how long he lived there I went down to be with him on my birthday  We went out to have lunch together and as we were waiting at a signal to cross the street this man came up and offered Senzakisan an apartment It was a very nice one it was at the top of the little hotel had an elevator It faced south Of course he had books stacked up in every direction although it was a larger place that he ever had before I dont recall how long he was there but quite a little while and then Mrs Tanahashi a wonderful woman who had been at Heart Mountain and who was very fond of Senzaki Sensei found a lovely duplex for him on East 1st Street right across from the house that she and her family were renting Mrs Tanahashi had a store in downtown for mochigashi and thats where I acquired a taste for Japanese sweets This duplex was a wonderful place for him it was so light and airy and he had a big kitchen and a nice bath It was great While he was there we moved north    Could we talk some more about Nyogen Senzaki as a person His early early past he was uncertain about As a matter of fact he didnt know when his birthday was so he just chose Buddhas birthday for himself When I first met him and continuing on  just about all the time I ever saw him  he was carrying himself very erect he was rather a large man He didnt look Japanese Id say he looked Chinese and he had the long Oriental fingers I can see myself so many times walking down the street with him in Little Tokyo and hed see somebody and his hand would go up like that it was never a wave never a handclasp it was just this He had been left here by Shaku Soen Daisetsu Suzuki had also come with Shaku Soen and gone on with him but the older roshi from Engakuji had told Senzaki Sensei to stay here and not to mention the B of Buddhism until he had been here many years And he didnt  When I took him to Japan I was struck  and I dont know whether it was because he was deeply emotional about returning to Japan after half a century or if it was his nature but as we came off the plane at Haneda there were a lot of people who had come to meet him who had made a great effort to get there twice as a matter of fact because when I had sent the date I had done it according to our calendar completely forgetting we were crossing the dateline But he paid no attention to them he just walked right past them he didnt stop to greet everybody  nothing We had been put up at a very lovely old Japanese house Fukudaya it was most special We stayed there for two or three days  Soen Roshi was with us  then Soen Roshi Senzaki Sensei and some funny little hangeron went north to Matsushima where Senzaki became very ill I think a lot of it was probably brought on by age because he was certainly not a young man but he insisted on eating oysters out of the Bay and that was probably what triggered it He was ill all the rest of the time in Japan until just the very last and he stayed with some people in Tokyo who were koto players How did you stay in touch with him after you moved north I didnt see much of him after moving to Northern California but I wrote to him as I had done when he was at Heart Mountain Whenever I was down which I was not too frequently I would go and see him A young woman came along  she was very fond of him  I cant remember her name maybe her last name was Orff she became a Zen nun and went to Southeast Asia to one of the convents out there I know that Soen Roshi visited her one time but she died very soon after she went out there she was out there maybe two or three years before she died She wasnt Japanese Oh no she was American very Caucasian Senzaki Sensei said that he had a new Kangetsu or something of that sort Did the physical distance mean that you were less involved with Zen when you came up here or where you just more on your own As far as I was concerned I was totally on my own I had been most of my life anyway I became very much interested in Krishnamurtis talks It seemed to me that what he talked about was what I understood as the essence of Zen Again there was no meditation you were just on your own Had there been any kind of disillusionment with Zen  There had been a disillusionment with Senzaki Sensei when I was in Japan Doctor Suzuki had been given an honorary medal or an honorarium of some reasonable substance for his work by the Imperial Government while we were in Japan One evening with Soen Roshi Senzaki Sensei and two or three people in the house where we were staying all of a sudden Senzaki said to me that I was there to get an honorarium too Well it had never even entered my mind But he was very insistent and very unpleasant and I thought of the times when I had taken care of him when he was really ill  John wouldve flipped had he known  and I was hurt and felt badly about it Curiously enough just at that time maybe even the next day we had been invited to a luncheon with a number of roshi and other Japanese and there was a man at the head of the table whose name I believe was Ogata who had come to the United States to be an assistant to Senzaki Sensei He said that Senzaki Sensei had a very strange idea about money and anybody he thought had money This filled in exactly with what had happened to me  On what basis could Senzaki Sensei make such a statement Good question I dont know I think Soen Roshi Senzaki Sensei and I had been kind of planning what was going to be done next You see Senzaki Sensei had stayed behind he had to he was ill I had gone on to Ryutakuji and other places with Soen Roshi From the background of Senzaki Sensei I learned later on I think hed had trouble with people in various places I think thats why he was brought to the United States because he was having trouble with people in Japan  In his biographical sketch Robert Aitken thinks that the trouble stemmed from Senzaki Senseis outspoken criticism of the RussoJapanese war in 1905 That maybe exactly it But I think in general he had trouble with people I had a friend for example who was very comfortably off lived in Pasadena and was anxious for whatever reason to get into Zen He just really treated her badly He was very interested in money but then hed make a remark about how stingy she was But there in Japan Soen Roshi eventually talked to him and as I was sitting on one of these little decks one day he came out and said Kangetsusan I guess it has been difficult I said It has been very difficult and very disillusioning So I would see him when Id go south but there was no longer that strong feeling Id had  In the meantime though you had developed a strong connection with Soen Roshi  Oh yes and that lasted until the very end because every time Soen Roshi would come to the United States he would phone me from Los Angeles and ifhe was coming up this way he would stay with me  The friendship to Soen Roshi overlapped that with Krishnamurti So did the disillusionment with Senzaki Sensei also lead to a disillusionment with Zen in general The interesting thing is that Helen Corral a former actress and a friend of mine always wanted me to go and hear Krishnaji and I wouldnt go She took Senzaki Sensei one time and when Senzaki Sensei was in Japan he talked to the monks of Ryutakuji one time and it was all about Krishnaji Later on I did go with Helen to hear Krishnaji and I found him most special I found what he said at least most special That went on for quite a while When Krishnamurti came back to the United States to stay he settled in Ojai and I used to go down there when hed give his talks in the Oak Grove As I see it it wasnt a matter of transferring so much as finding something that was sort of mildly renewing because I was alone the whole time both in Zen and then with Krishnaji meaning I had no one to share it with  Did you follow a certain practice during all those years You mentioned once that you got up every morning a few hours before the rest of the family And we were an early rising family There were two things I used to have to write I absolutely physically had to write So what I would do in the early morning hours for there was no other time during the day in that period of my life I would just start out with nothing of nothing and let it flow from there to see what happened in a sort of stream of consciousness It was primarily for me because I did have to write and as I would write I would find certain things floating up to the surface that were good so it was therapeutic  Was it journal writing or did you write fiction It was neither although one could say it was partly fictional But I would just let it take its own course It was not journal writing although I had done that years and years before  What happened to these writings I wrote about a file drawer full of stuff and later I burned most of it I may have a few pieces here now but I doubt it because I got to the point where far from having to write and wanting to write I couldnt write And that surprised me because it just never occurred to me that  something of that character could disappear It had been very strong ever since I first learned to hold a pencil  When did it disappear Im guessing Id say late sixties  Duncan and Keith were already grown up Oh yes  To go back to Krishnaji how did you actually meet him This is curious I was at home and Keith and Duncan were home for summer vacation and I dont remember how but I heard that Krishnaji was going to give some talks in Gstaad I called the travel agency to find out were Gstaad was and the travel agency didnt know That shows you how far back that goes  Anyway two days later I was on my way to Gstaad Keith and Duncan had been wonderful I asked them how they would feel about it if I went and was gone for about six weeks They looked at each other and it was okay So I got over there and that time the talks were held at the Landhaus in Saanen I remember I sat on the aisle pretty much in a direct line with Krishnaji about halfway back and I had the feeling the moment he sat down and started looking around there was this connection between us  it was very strong A day or so later I asked if I could have an interview with Krishnaji I was asked if it was important and I said Yes it is A day or so later I went out to take myself for a walk  it had been raining ever since I arrived in Gstaad but just then the rain momentarily let up I went along the river and of course the weeds were twelve inches high and sopping wet I walked thinking my own thoughts  whatever they were  and suddenly I looked up and there was Krishnaji in front of me with a woman whom he introduced as Vanda Scaravelli He said to me I got your request and Ill see you The next day I was at Grassmanns a very fancy and very expensive supplier of whatever food one needs for the household and Vanda was there She said Come to lunch tomorrow They lived at Chalet Tannegg which was quite high up above Gstaad I went expecting other people to be there too but there were none There was Krishnaji Vanda Vandas son Alberto and me From there on it seemed that wherever I went the moment I stepped out of my room I ran into Krishnaji Hed be in a car and hed get out of the car and stop me as I went along It seemed to me that what he talked about was the essence of Zen as I understood Zen you cant quiet the  brain it is impossible the brain wont quiet But getting to that point where the brain has to be quiet by itself because in essence it simply doesnt know the answer that meant a lot to me That was it  Did you ever discuss that with Soen Roshi I dont think I ever said anything to him but he understood As you know Gunther there comes a point when a person is simply clear enough that he effortlessly knows not only what he is thinking or feeling but what other people are thinking or feeling too Its no gimmick its just one of the steps that comes So what Im saying is he knew Im sure I feel sure too that he talked to Senzaki Sensei when we were in Japan I dont know what he said but I think it included the fact that I had taken very good care of Senzaki Sensei really not at risk but against my own family feelings because John was very antagonistic about him Before we were married I told John there were two things I wanted to do go on with my writings  at that time I was working at 20 th Century Fox  and I said I wanted to go on with religion Of course the writing was knocked out right away  my fault because I acquiesced but of course I was threatened if I didnt do such and such  But I never let anything touch what I would call my religion I didnt talk about it I didnt read books during times when I would bother the person but thats the way it was  Were Keith and Duncan more on your or on their fathers side I never discussed it with them They were little boys and occasionally they would come up and find me meditating I just stopped immediately but stayed where I was we talked together and so forth It is interesting to me now that they both have  or I should say they each have  a very strong tendency toward religion Each in his own way Keith is much more the conventional and has taken a major step  he didnt tell me he was going to do it he just went ahead and did it and told me afterwards about a year ago and Duncan in his way has done it also  it is not as formal perhaps as Keiths is but anyway  To go back to my initial question did your involvement with Krishnaji affect your relationship with Soen Roshi No I dont think so Not from my point of view As I said every time Soen Roshi came to this country he phoned to me and if he was coming up hed stay with me So I dont think it did it at all I feel Gunther as the years have gone by Im less and less constricted or conforming    You told me more than once how Buddhism and Zen came about but we never once talked about The Iron Flute What made you write The Iron Flute The first part of The Iron Flute I didnt do Salamon Reps had done that with Senzaki Sensei I think it was Tuttle who said that he had heard and who then published it As to Buddhism and Zen that came about because Senzaki Sensei had been sent  or told it was available to him  the whole Tripitaka the Delge Edition which is all on little wooden blocks beautifully brocaded books that open up I was down on East 1st one day after he had moved to that wonderful place that Shubinsan had gotten for him and he said that he was to be sent the entire Tripitaka and asked me what to do with it I replied Thats easy why dont you send it to Yale There is nothing much outside of Asia that would have the Tripitaka the British Museum has a few volumes and Yale and thats about all He asked why I didnt think of Stanford I said I didnt think Stanford would be interested It happened just as it so often does that that very night as I was looking at the little Pasadena evening paper that right on the front page there was a little squib about a Dr Frederick Spiegelberg of Stanford who was going to Asia  The next time I came up to San Francisco area I went to Dr Sokol who was the head of the Asian Studies Department at Stanford and I asked him what they would think about having the whole Tripitaka Oh he was beside himself with delight and then he wanted to know how I came to know about such a thing I told him about my involvement with Zen and he was just as excited about that I could see him sit at the edge of his chair When the Tripitaka was delivered to Stanford Senzaki Sensei and I went into Wallace Stagners office I think he was the president of Stanford at the time  and there was the head of the Library Association at Stanford Dr Stone and Dr John Dodds the Dean of Graduate Humanities we were all in Dr Stagners office the red carpet was rolled out nicely and all of a sudden there was one of these silences and I made the biggest turmoiled blast out of my hungry tummy It just reverberated off the walls A moment or two later Dr Stone said I think its time we all went to lunch So we all went to lunch The last I heard of all these books was that for a while they were put in some special library at Stanford Later they were all sent over to Berkeley where they were being studied by scholars This I must confess rather annoyed me But if they are studied I guess thats good  And where are they now Good question I havent the foggiest  But writing these books on Zen did not make you part of any community of scholars or people who practiced Zen No I never got any medals if thats what you mean Or do you mean people like Gary Snyder No they were later And no I was never part of it  And having written these books didnt mean that people contacted you or that you were invited to talk about Zen No I did get a little notice one day from a French woman at the United Nations who wanted to translate my books into French I said Certainly and she did The others Snyder and Kerouac came much later Later with respect to my beginnings If I consider how quiet I had to be and how they splashed around and jumped around and there was a whole group of them that thought that any inane statement was a Zen statement Now thats past too but now everyone in the United States and I guess in Europe too knows the word Zen Thats something I had never imagined when I started out because it was such a remote unknown thing    We developed kind of a red thread talking about the various people that were important in your life Senzaki Sensei Soen Roshi Krishnaji You also mentioned your disillusionment with Senzaki Was there any such thing with Soen Roshi or with Krishnaji No Only in a very humorous way I suppose somehow because of my own maturity Senzaki Sensei did have a great fondness for money and a peculiar attitude about people who had it I never saw anything like this with Soen Roshi at all and there was no disillusionment but the only thing I was a wee bit surprised  but it certainly didnt spoil it for me  was that he was very ceremonial But I loved his humor He had such a quick spontaneous humor very intelligent and he had a quality about him that seemed to endear him to people and to animals  I remember in Pasadena one day driving him up to a house  as a matter of fact we were going to pick up Helen Corral  and there was a big dog Helen had often warned me about the dog she said it was an attack dog I drove up stopped the car and before I could turn off the ignition Soen Roshi was out of the car through the little white gate and here was this dog this enormous dog rushing out I can see Soen Roshi saying Yes very furious dog very furious dog and the dog wagging his tail But I also remember being on the train with him in Japan and people would just congregate they just would be drawn to him And he always seemed to have time for everybody to say something As for Krishnaji Krishnaji was very fond of beautiful British clothes handmade shoes and that type of things  he kept them polished so that you would scarcely see anything else That surprised me a lot but actually as I said earlier everybody every biped in the world who has been and possibly who will be has something of that sort Its just part of being human In my Protestant days I was just very narrow about it in my feelings Thank heavens I got over it in time to wake up and see the sun rise  The last person in this string of remarkable men you told me about was Brugh Joy Yes I first came across that name in May of 79 when I went to see a friend by the name of Louise Pedellford who lived down south in Claremont and who was ill at the time One of the things Louise and I used to like to do was to read aloud to each other Louise said she had a book it was marked and would I please read it to her It was marked just about halfway through So I started reading and immediately found a strong resonance So I asked if I could borrow it that night when she went to sleep I know very well that had I just picked up that book I would not have read it    The book was Joys Way by Brugh Joy I would not have read it It starts out on Tarot which I dont care for at all he did mention the Ching which I have had and enjoyed occasionally quite a while But Ill tell you now that I dont feel the same about Tarot I wouldnt get myself involved and go on and on and on about it but in its place its okay It seemed to me  I gathered it from the book and it was substantiated when I saw him  that Brugh Joy embodied all the things that I had found in Krishnaji and Soen Roshi only he was a native Californian very good scholastic background so much so that his interest and backing of certain things really made me take another look at them Then I decided I better go to one of these workshops and see what he was like I phoned up and the earliest they could get me in was  on a waiting list  for the following ·March I asked them to put me down and they did Then one day in late August I got a phone call and they told me they had a place at the end of August and they asked if I could come I said yes I didnt look at a calendar I just simply said yes I drove down to Sky Hi in the Mojave Desert There were 38 or 40 of us it was a big sess10n I liked Brugh very much He was young at the time  in fact hes just six month older than Keith  and had graduated with honors from USC and USC Medical School as you know from the book probably Thats been interesting with him and Soen Soen is brilliant really and has a marvelous sense of humor Did I mention to you a man by the name of Oliver Hall He was in that first session I was in a youngish man maybe your age We were seated on the floor in this room and Brugh Joy was thinking of something and finally he asked what day of the week it was This Oliver Hall spoke up and said Do you mean to tell us that here you are guiding all these people and you dont even know what day of the week it is  If  And Duncan tells me that this new place he has in Arizona is just beautiful  You also went to Hawaii for a workshop didnt you Yes that was about six years ago I went with my big floppy straw hat summer clothes denim skirt  and it poured the whole time We had a house right on the beach Brugh Joy has lightened up his groups a lot  at least the ones I know about  now its usually not more than twelve people  What were the insights you derived from these workshops what did you learn I dont know that I can put it down that way You know I spent my life alone most of the time So these workshops gave me some support and confirmation at times and I just feel that although I dont know how much of it contributed to my general growth without it I would be perhaps a little bit different So I feel it has contributed to my growth But thats nothing I could substantiate of course  This takes us into the realm of beliefs and ideas you have developed in the course of about sixty years from reading Garden of Vision up until today I would say this very definitely There was a time when people would talk about praying to God And it bothered me because I dont happen to believe in an anthropomorphic God I feel to have held that belief has held back Western civilization a great deal But Ive come to the point where I feel very definitely that anybody anywhere  downtown San Mateo or faraway Polynesia  the person is praying sincerely not asking something for himself  I mean some material thing  I feel that all goes to the same source that there isnt this differentiation and that it is cumulative and it all contributes to the general growth and development of humanity  You therefore feel that humanity is developing Laughs   I know what youre saying and I thought it many a time Slowly but surely yes I do  As a whole or individually I feel very definitely individually And of course as there is cohesion there because like seeks like it will be more general But I feel very definitely its individual And I feel that it always has been And I feel further that there always have been individuals who were very very highly developed and really did what they could do to move mankind  along Sometimes to their woe burning at the stake or something else of the sort I would say this century has certainly seen the worst atrocities committed by humans towards other humans and I dont think we have seen the end of it considering how things are developing in exYugoslavia and in other places There just seems to be so much tension around  There is   and to take so little to spark off some violent confrontation Maybe some people me included  thought that after World War II certain things just wouldnt happen again But now Im not so sure anymore that thats the case on the contrary they could very well happen again They could certainly There are several things in what you said I do feel that so much of our apparent feeling as far as mankind is concerned is veneer It is not very deep It doesnt take much to trigger it off into violence On the other hand I feel that there are people who seem to need violence around them in order to feel alive its like they dont feel theyre living unless they have everything stirred up Just take all this nonsense about blacks now You cant look at a TV picture or pick up a newspaper without it being the thing Look weve had wonderful blacks Theres Dr Thomas Soul at Stanford for example Clarence Thomas on the Supreme Court in spite of Anita Hill I feel when they stop talking about it so much and from the wrong point of view  not all people were slaves nor were all slaves badly treated besides a lot of the people brought over here were not brought by Americans I remember seeing a TV film one night on current modern slavery It showed  I suppose through a long distance lens and a certain kind of lighting  blacks being brought off a plane shackled one to the other coming down the ramps andbeing put on an enormous truck that had the curtains down on all sides and whisked away They were being sold as slaves Where was that This happened to be on the Arabian Peninsula But who sold them Well one of the filmmakers went to the area in Africa where they had been picked up and he himself for a pittance bought a black slave from another black So what does one do What can be done And you know we had long since stopped bringing in slaves and this is one of the things overlooked by people because they dont know and the media certainly dont bother to point out that that happened to be a period of time when lots of people were indentured Theyd come over here and work six or seven years and as a matter of fact I feel  that Danuta is indentured to her son who is over here It was a common way of life Then all of a sudden our mores changed and we blame everybody thats not quite right    Tell me more on your family background Duncan told me a few things about your Polish grandmother who had traveled widely before coming to this country and who seemed to have fled Poland because of some political turmoil All I know is what I have been told which is that she was about 19 when the family was taken away Her father and grandfather were in what we would today call the underground Poland was under Russia and I guess they knew it was just a matter of time that they would be picked up and possibly separated So they agreed all to meet at a certain place when they could and sure enough one night the family was at dinner and in came the Russian soldiers and had the family lined up in front of the fireplace my grandmother was wearing some earrings and one of the soldiers just yanked them out of her ears Then they were bundled into a horsedrawn vehicle and she told my mother the last thing that she remembers of her home which she never saw again was the closing of these big iron gates and the sentry walking up and down She was taken I dont know where with the family but she managed to break away from the group it was midwinter and she went snowblind She never saw another member of the family after that She never knew what had ever become of them She had been married not long before to a boy named Victor Suchandsuch  How did she get to Switzerland I dont know I dont even know whether it was from Russia or Poland Somehow she got over to the United States where she married a man whose name I dont know and by him she had another child a girl named Olga Samarita Olga Samarita was seven years older than my mother In fact Aunt Olga told me one time that she remembered going to the bedside after my mother was born and seeing my mother They had different fathers however because apparently Olgas father had died an early death and when my grandmother married George Tarbell he just gave his name to Olga and also to Victor By that marriage there was my mother followed two years later by Elliot George whom we always called Uncle Major This was because as a little boy his father had nicknamed him Major of Mischief He had a wonderful sense of humor and a remarkable memory He could go to a Vaudeville show and come home and repeat it verbatim right straight through  They lived in Santa Rosa and Uncle Major ran away and worked on the Delta riverboats Mother said there were too many women in the family for him and I can see that my grandmother and Aunt Olga who always wanted to run the show anyway and my mother were too much for him So Uncle major worked on the riverboats  the old Delta Queen and Delta King  and then later on he deliberately lied about his age and enlisted in the Navy And thats where he spent his life in the Navy  Now what time was that My mother was born in 1882 so he was borne in 84 and I would guess he enlisted around 1900 He spent most of his time in the Navy in the Orient I dont remember particularly how that came about but thats the way it was  So you didnt see him very often Oh no very seldom One of my earliest memories goes back to when I was 2½ I know that because when I mentioned it to my father one time he said I could not remember that because I was too small I said Well Ill describe where we were living we were living in a little apartment and we were there apparently just a very short time and it had the most unusual floor plan I drew the floor plan for him  he was convinced My mother had a remarkable memory and a remarkable ear You could read my mother anything without any proper nouns and shed tell you wil • My grandmother wanted Olga and my mother to go to Stanford Stanford was very very young of course at that time and so she moved down from Santa Rosa to Palo Alto The last time I was down there the house they livedin was still standing and whoever had it had been loving it up It was nicely painted in a soft gray and a white trim it was a Victorian hose of course and it was on Cowper Street  So both your mother and your aunt went to Stanford Yes right My aunt majored in zoology and my mother majored in English  and Im chuckling because in those days an English major had to be able to read AngloSaxon Mother told about one time she was studying with a small group of friends and she could not find the place So one of the friends leaned around picked up the book and turned it back right side up Yes Mother had a remarkable memory and a wonderful sense of humor which has always delighted me It was a very dry quiet humor She would see a lot of things most people didnt even notice  So you probably got some of your sense of humor from her Yes or whoever it came from My uncle had a marvelous sense of humor He could keep you cracked up steadily  And where does your mothers interest in China or the Far East stem from I have no idea I dont know But it was also in Olga Olga was very fond of Oriental things As a matter of fact that cloisonne lamp base on the living room table was something Olga gave to Mother years ago and Mother had it made into a lamp I have no idea And I dont remember anything ever being said that would indicate even so slightly how it came about  When did your grandmother die She died I believe in 1902  Before you were born Oh yes I never knew either of my grandmothers My paternal grandmother died when my father was just nine years old But its interesting also about my maternal grandmother that although I never knew her when I was growing up from about the time when I was eleven twelve at the most and on for a number of years I felt very close to her I felt as though I knew her  of course Id never even seen her    My mother was a very attractive woman She was not a classic beauty at all but she had a lovely figure and she had beautiful hair most unusual in color and deep blue eyes When I went to Stanford I took a class in communications as they would say now and happened to have the same professor that my mother had had when she was there He told me he would just get the class started and go and sit down behind her  she used to sit near the window  and just watch the light on her hair It was so beautiful he said  Did your mother meet your father at Stanford No they met in Santa Rosa High School My father also went to Stanford but he stayed out a year between high school and college to earn  some money then he stayed out of Stanford again during his junior year to earn money so that he could go on  What did he study Civil engineering Actually his older brother Ernest Strout who was a mining engineer went to Stanford he was about twothree years older than my father He told my father he would loan him the money and he could pay him back after he got out of college My father told me I had such a horror of being in debt I just refused Had I known then what I know now  how easy it was to make money once I was out  I could have accepted But he didnt He hashed he had a laundry route I really admire that here was this little fellow whose mother died when he was nine years old his father remarried quite soon after that and he couldnt possibly have had much encouragement to do what he did But they were five boys and they all went through university through Stanford  Your father and your mother having gone to Stanford it was only natural that you too would go to Stanford Thats right And my cousin went she was there the same time I was the daughter of the mining engineer  You were an only child Yes  And your family lived in the East Bay at the time in Oakland Yes Alameda was the name of the place and I went to Alameda High  So did you take a ferry to go to Palo Alto If I commuted  which was very seldom actually  Id take a boat to the City and then the train  a real train the old iron rooster  to go down to Palo Alto I didnt do that very often because I was given a car and I drove when I came home    When did you graduate from Stanford  I was in the class of 31 but I was graduated in 32 because when I started out I majored in art which was very foolish of me and came about in a strange foolish way Then of course came the Depression and my father wanted me to do something useful and besides I wasnt all that good at art anyway  What specifically did you study painting or art history Well art history was included a very mild form of it but very interesting and I had a wonderful professor for that What I should have done and what I would have loved doing  if this strange accident hadnt happened  was to be an English major As it was I took a creative writing minor I loved it as I did literature and those things  What was that strange accident Instead of going down to Stanford at the beginning of the year it just happened that I was graduated from High School at Christmas time The odd thing was that my family had never  even when I was in grammar school as a little girl  allowed me to be skipped But here we were that I could graduate from High School at Christmas time and they had me do it I would much rather have stayed on and have that semester taking things not for credit but because I liked them But no they popped me right into Stanford and of course I missed all the orientation which had gone on at the beginning of the fall quarter with the arriving freshmen all of that To show you how far out in left field I was my first class the day after registration was an 800 biology class I went fully expecting the professor to say Good morning students Im Dr Soandso and well be covering such and such No way he got up and started lecturing right away I didnt have a pad with me nothing like that I was just out of step it was just a very difficult period for me And I dont know how this started but already in High School I had become very interested in art and art history I remember reading a 4vol set from the La Jolla Library one summer that I was down there on art history So when I went into Stanford I went into the Deans office and she was going to make out my program for me She said What are you interested in I looked up at the corner of the room and said Art and she put me down for a class of art appreciation  or maybe just recognition  and it was a 5unit class Now I had never taken notes in the dark and of course they showed slides during classes it was just a very very difficult time At that time there were only 500 girls and 2500 boys among the undergraduates  that was set by the charter So there were a lot of adjustments a lot of tuning let alone the finetuning to be done  Were you already writing at the time Oh yes I have a stenographers notebook I wrote in in pencil and the first story  I well remember  I wrote when I was in sixth grade as an assignment The assignment was to write a story that would be like a fable I did and most of my story was conversation which was considered pretty sophisticated for a sixthgrader  And you had taken creative writing as a minor Yes and that was wonderful because I took it under far and away my favorite professor Edith Mirrielees who was also a Stanford graduate a wonderful woman and most amazing person When you were in her class you could literally hear a pen drop She was very quiet and gentle but a firm disciplinarian for example if something was supposed to be in at 1005 then 1007 wouldnt do I took one course from her which she held in her office  which had a long table  and I sat right next to her We went right around the table and each person had a day to talk about what he was writing about get criticism on it discuss it and so forth I just loved it and itd be just tense listening and Id be crossing and recrossing my legs and invariably I would hit her in the shin I apologized and shed accept my apologies So it went on and finally one day she said Well Ruth no one will ever accuse you of apple polishing I adored her  Did you feel you were able to develop your writing skills in those classes I felt I was pretty good for a long time I dont know just when I thought I might be getting better  Was the criticism you received for instance helpful I mean before you had always been on your own Yes I had done my writing for myself and by myself but of course through grammar school and high school there were assignments from time to time But what I planned to do what I expected to do once I got out of college was to write It never entered my head that Id be doing anything else and thats what I told John that I was going to write After I was out of college as you know my mother died about a year later and I had a job in the city at the California Schoolbook Depository I got it when I was working in Palo Alto at the secretarial school and they set me up some day to get some books and I was just like a hunting dog tail wagging sniffing and I picked up the books and as I went down in the elevator I asked the elevator boy who the manager was He told me and I asked if I could leave the books in the elevator with him and if he could take me up He said yes So I went back up 22  and asked for the manager I told him that I liked to have a job there Now this was the trough of the Depression and its hard to realize how depressed it really was The manager asked me a few questions and then he said My partner is down south now but I tell you what you do you write to me what you just told me and when hes back Ill show it to him and get in touch with you It was very shortly after that that they told me to come up to the city What they wanted me to do was the following they had inquiries about certain books from all over the world answering these letters dictating answers I should say  took a lot of time So they wanted somebody who could simply write the letters look up the material and everything so they could sign it I got the job I remember very well that John was up in San Francisco at that time and I told him that I was going to get 100 a month he said Oh no youre not Youre mistaken They never pay a woman 100 a month As it turned out I did get 100 per month  and for writing So things went along but it was very hard because I lived at home and my father expected the house to be run just as my mother had run it and meals served so my days were overly full I had to be at work in San Francisco at 8 oclock in the morning and worked of course until 500 Id pick up things at the little market on my way home walk the three blocks home and cook dinner  no dishwasher back then  I can understand that he wanted it the same but it meant a lot of extra work table linen on the table and off the table and so forth Things went along  I dont know how long  that way until one day at work I just collapsed I didnt faint I dont know what happened I just went bang It didnt take them long to decide they didnt need that kind of person So thats what happened When I told my father that I didnt have my job anymore he grew very difficult and he decided to rent the house He did but he rented it furnished complete with our sterling silver  everything So I decided it was no place for me and I went south to see if I could get a job down there And where did you go Los Angeles I had known in class a boy by the name of Dick Irvine and I heard that he was working for one of the studios I got in touch with him and he was working for one of the studios and he suggested that I come out to that studio he said he couldnt guarantee anything but at least I could come out for an interview So I borrowed a car and drove out He very thoughtfully had this woman who was the secretary of the Art Department at United Artists take me to lunch and interview me at that time When lunch was over she said Well we dont have anything right now but Ill keep you in mind  Just a few days later I got a call that Geoffrey Farwell who was the head of publicity for United Artists was looking for someone I went out to see him The interesting thing was that I was going to be paid for I was the second secretary not the first  35 a week which was terrific but Geoffrey Farwell apologized He said Im sorry if its not more So I worked there and John and I were married in September of that year 1934 I had told John that I wanted to continue my writing and what I called my religion Now one of the places I went to when I was looking for a job was in Beverly Hills it was a writers agency a very poshlooking place I remember So while I was working at United Artists writing publicity  and to digress again dont ever believe what you read about these various artists and stars because any resemblance to the truth is just coincidental  I had a call one day to get in touch with Reginald Berkeley He had done the script for a picture that was high up called Cavalcade He wanted a secretary so I had a call from this Writers Agency and was told that he wanted somebody but that he had a terrible temper As a matter of fact his most recent secretary had left because he had thrown a typewriter at her I went to see him at 20 th Century Fox where he had been given one of their bungalows It was an interesting interview because as I went in he never once asked me one blessed thing about my background my possible ability my experience nothing But he hired me on the spot I was to work for him not for the studio which meant that early in the morning I had to go to his little house on Crescent Drive in Beverly Hills and he would walk up and down in front of me and dictate but he was amazing in all the time that I worked for him I dont believe three times he said Scratch that And a movie script is very difficult you have two columns you have the dialogue the action and directions for the action over here and you have this other column of camera directions He carried that whole thing in his head Somebody came to the doof one day and the little Filipino he had answered it and then came to speak to him and he turned abso1utely purple literally I wouldnt have thought that anybody could get that color He was wild he was so angry He had said during the interview when I went to see him in the studio I suppose youve heard about my temper I said Yes I had He said Will it bother you I said If I felt that it was unjustified it would No more was said I would go to his home in the morning and he would dictate pacing up and down Then I would go over to the studio to transcribe and he would show up at about four or five oclock bright as a newminted dime ready just to go on again And he would have been to a luncheon someplace he would have played some hands of bridge afterwards and gone with a group swimming or playing tennis And  here was Ruthy Grind really working and tired And we had no phone in our funny little house up the 72 steps from the road  and I do mean road because it was unpaved But I was getting a fantastic amount of money for those days I was being paid by the week which helps I came home one night it was probably about 7 oclock or 730 John was livid with rage and he said This cant go on You just have to stop or itll break up our marriage And I said Look I told you I was going to be doing this That doesnt make any difference So when I went back to the studio the next day I told Reginald Berkeley that I was recently married and that my husband was very upset at the uncertain hours I was getting home He wrote me a very handsome cheque and said I was the best goddam secretary hed ever had When I told Duncan he said He didnt say that And I said Thats exactly what he said Well and that was it After that it didnt matter at all if I went to work in musty dusty fusty little insurance office for thirty dollars a month But I didnt stay long I liked the person I was working for but I didnt care for the type of work Anyway a friend of mine who was a DG Delta Gamma from UCLA who had a group of DGs that met periodically asked me Ruth you read so much would you be willing to give a book review at our next meeting I said Yes Id be glad to I did and then out of that they asked me if I would give a kind of class that would meet periodically on literature Well you know Ruthy was happy to and from there we went on to World Literature That helped some because in that little house where we lived I was completely isolated I loved the location but I was just sort of cut off from people And that was where I was living when I came across Garden of Vision  Did you ever regret not having been able to go on writing Oh yes and especially not having been able to go on with my work at the studio because I was learning very fast Its a different kind of writing and I dont know that I would have gone into that kind of writing They also needed book reviewers at those studios and they needed somebody to put it in some kind of form It would have been a fun job for a while and a good experience I continued to write but this was primarily for myself Some place or other I even came across an epic poem I wrote    ZS  After I moved up north especially after John and I were separated I would often go to visit Edith Mirrielees that wonderful writing professor I told you about earlier Of course by that time she was emeritus but she had a nice little house just a couple of blocks from campus and I would drive down to Stanford and take her out to lunch in another town so we could have a nice drive and talk I remember I was going to go abroad in a day or so and I went down to see her I knew when I saw her that I would not be seeing her again I knew also  although it had never been mentioned or referred to in any way  that she was extremely sensitive and I was afraid that she would pick up my feeling And sure enough I got over to London and I was staying on HalfMoon St at the Fanning Hotel and there I had word from several of my friends over here that she had passed away Wonderful wonderful woman   CJape 3  You mentioned coming up to see your teacher the creative writing teacher from Stanford and then you went to London and then you heard that she had passed on Did she ever encourage you to start again with writing or did you not talk about that I dont remember that we ever talked about that particularly I think she just assumed that I would go on writing and during Johns and my separation I stayed pretty well away from friends Finally when everything was over she asked me why I had done that and I told her I can remember we were driving and she just reached over and she took my hand and pressed it She was very understanding I have since come to the conclusion I believe she was psychic she was very wide open I guess I mentioned earlier when I was leaving her she picked up what I felt Frankly shes one of the persons Im looking forward to seeing before to long thats a fact  I thought that before when you were talking when you were telling the story Well there are several and shes one of them    So did you have anything you wanted to ask  Yes there are a few things Id like to know first Id like to hear as much as possible about your life about certain decisions about the people in your life your meetings with remarkable men to quote the title of a book by Gurdjieff for instance Senzaki Sensei Soen Roshi D T Suzuki Krishnamurti and up to Brugh Joy Besides you taught me many things over the years is there anything you havent mentioned yet  The only thing that I can say that does occur to me its more from my position now but it applies equally to the past times is the following I feel that anything a person really wishes to do he should do and not allow himself to be dissuaded and if he doesnt write well all right he doesnt write well but at least he satisfies whatever that is in him And I say that it applies to anything that a person feels that he really wishes to do I give you a very recent example of something comparable Don called me one day about four weeks ago and said that he wanted to buy a little Mazda of a certain type and it was very expensive I asked if he had it all worked out about the payment and we went around the various possibilities Finally he asked What do you think I said I think you ought to get it because if you want it and if its right for you thats great youll enjoy it and if it isnt that will soon be apparent and you will have learned a lesson So you cant lose either way  And he got it because he said yesterday that he had it Yes and he is very happy with it So Id say that that is pretty much now my general attitude I dont know why I said now To the best of my knowledge I have encouraged Keith and Duncan to do what they wanted to do when they wanted to do it And also to the best of my knowledge I have supported them I think Duncan feels that I havent very often and he may be right I do think this Gunther and its not necessarily to apply for the rest of your life but I do think that you have been very wise as is Duncan in not marrying you were freer to travel where you wish and to do as you wish without extra responsibilities and the feeling that you are affecting somebody else Good To answer your question tO the best of my knowledge there is nothing else except things that just may float up as were together and visiting I mean no there is no great secret nothing like that I was telling Duncan the other day  he is feeling very much at loose ends and he doesnt like Santa Fe he doesnt quite know what to do with himself he feels he has painted all he wants to paint and so forth  so I said Well I did know definitely not only from personal experience but Ive come across it one time also somewhere that in a persons life there is a preparation for transition The person will feel very uneasy feel that he lacks security and has no idea what is really going on And it is a kind of prelude its almost a requirement of a shift thats about to take place  Yes I felt that experience quite a few times myself This is exactly how it happened  Yes Im sure of it yes  Are there any questions you wanted to ask  Well the one that I asked you before was the most important one I wanted to ask I wanted to make that clear because in the course of the years there always passed quite a bit of time between one visit and the other and we have written and sometimes spoken over the telephone but I certainly didnt get to see you as often as I would have liked to Do you feel that thats been answered now Or do you feel that there are bits and pieces perhaps that could be further clarified  I am curious about your ideas as a kind of bottom line after sixty years that you studied that you learned that you developed that you grew Well Im sure Ive told you Gunther one thing in the first place nothing new about it either I dont think there is anything such as we generally understand by the word death I dont think it exists I do think yes we turn in our suits but everything else goes right on I think that that part of this that goes along then can be used in various ways in some ways to and to the general benefit of humanity a little bit like  did you ever have any chemistry  Some yes but not very much  Do you remember the experiment that you did for the end point of titration  No Well you have what looks like a perfectly clear liquid  water  and you put in one drop at a time and it keeps on looking just the same it doesnt alter in the slightest There is one final drop that you put in and that turns the whole thing pink It is called the end point of titration I feel that a lot of what I would call the work is of that nature its toward the end point of titration I think Weiss book is very much that way He didnt write it till three years after it was all over but consider the number of people its affected in various ways that as far I can see couldnt be anything but good helpful He had to swallow the possibility that he would be the laughing stock of the scientific community but I think its very important and I think that the individual as he goes along is doing just that Now there are those who certainly seem not to do it  the ones who are  v1c10us and cause so much trouble  but I find myself now as something comes up trying to remember  and I still have to use the word try  trying to remember that eventually later rather than sooner these people will have to come to the point where that stops This everybody has to Is that anywhere near what you wanted to ask  Yes Im hoping that when Ill turn in my suit that it would be possible for me still to go on working a bit on the person we now call Ruth Strout McCandless but I dont know whether that will be or not nor even the kind of work that I would like to do on her or at least that I think I would like to do on her at this point So  I dont know   According to the Tibetan tradition a lot depends on the state of mind you re in how clear your mind is and how stable you are able to maintain it as you go through that final transition final relatively speaking That may be absolutely exactly right I remember the time  I have just told you about this briefly  I remember the time of Soen Roshi mothers death He was with her that last period of time working with her and I couldnt imagine why but yes its something like that Im quite sure  Did you ever talk to him about that No I didnt because probably I didnt even think of it when I was around him Outstanding person he was   I still find it amazing how we found out about his death that Duncan and I would go to a lecture by Peter Matthiessen and he would announce it and we both heard it for the first time because he had just learned it Yes I think thats amazing How did he happen to mention it  That is a good question He was reading from several of his books I dont know why he mentioned it He just suddenly said it and I dont know how many people knew who that person was but certainly Duncan and I did He wrote about him in Nine Headed Dragon River but that came out much later three years later The Snow Leopard is dedicated to three people and one of them is Soen Roshi But to be honest I dont remember why he said it that evening probably because he was very much affected by it he had just heard it and maybe thats why he felt he wanted to say it    So now the tape is on As you have been getting things ready for the tape two or three things about the channeling have occurred to me Two of them more recently at Kauai with Brugh Joy The first night I guess it was when we all arrived there in this house Brugh Joy asked if anything had come through to us individually I said that I found it very interesting I found myself on the shore it was night and there was a storm and the shore was just exactly at the edge of this little valley that is at the end of the Nepali trail in Kauai The mountains above were covered with storm clouds It was a very wild elemental elementary time but I could not get out or away from the plantation it was all right there Now Brugh Joy said Well you have touched exactly on what we are going to be doing here this time and he said everything will be contained right here and for us Then at that same session there was a man who was having quite a lot of difficulty so one day Brugh said Would you like some feedback on this The man said yes so we went right around this circle of twelve people and one person I well remember said There is nothing really wrong you are just fine as you are   Anyway he got to me and I said Well as I was coming down I found myself floating and it came to me that as you float you will be all right Then we moved on to the next few people At the end Brugh said Now has anything been said that you found helpful And he added I will give you this tape But pay particular attention to what Ruth said to you Now have you ever heard Carolyn Conger  No I havent Carolyn Conger is also a psychic she teaches Years ago she was having a small session in a private home up in Mill Valley outside Mill Valley in the country a lovely place and she had us sitting in a semicircle one day The twelve of us made six paired off a man and a woman a woman and a man She said first to pick up what we felt from that person And when it came to me I said to the man You are on a catboat going through Raccoon Straits Raccoon Straits is up here in San Francisco Bay He said No I was on a surfboard  And the woman right next to him said I was in a catboat in Raccoon Straits So I said to Caroline I said How do you know what station are you picking up And she said Well pretty soon you get used to it And lots of times in the past I have I dont know whether to say thought or felt neither one quite fits that I knew exactly what a person was thinking But somehow I didnt give it any validity Well probably the fact that in Zen Buddhism no attention is paid to such phenomena they are just considered mikkyo delusions  Yes that may have had something to do with it Yes but on the other hand if I think about things that you told me in the past and about books like the Betty Books or the one that you once gave me called The Job of Living these were always books in which channeling played an important role so somehow this has always accompanied you and you must have accepted the idea because otherwise you wouldve thought that these books were rubbish But the fact that you did treasure them and that you even gave me one to read implies that you believe in it Yes I do think there has always been that Gunther but that I believe is more my very very deep interest that goes way way back to what the world calls religion So it was only after this telephone conversation with Barbara Courtney that you felt that you were also a channel Before it happened and maybe you were surprised but this confirmed it I believe thats correct I really havent thought much about it but I believe thats correct  And has that changed anything Perhaps it has given me the feeling of more validity in these things more credence But has that contributed to maybe more information coming through or has the fact that you have given it more credence more validity activated the channel in any way I feel it is because I pay more attention to it I dont feel anything more is coming through I feel actually as I look back there always has been coming through that it was just I who was in the way or didnt leave it And again you see in the time of life and in the group of people that  I grew up with and associated with even the word psychic was like waving a red flag at somebody it was just that we didnt believe in any of that  Well then let me go a little bit more into the biographical part again Maybe something else will come through as well  Yes  It was very interesting what you told me yesterday about Senzaki Sensei about that shadow part of him that led to the disillusionment you felt about him Now all I know about Senzaki Sensei is the few things that I read about him for instance what Robert Aitken wrote and a few bits and pieces here and there and the things that you told me but its still a very sketchy idea that comes out of that Could you maybe give me a few more pieces to the puzzle He was a very strong person in appearance as well as in his decision to do anything or not do anything I never thought about that so much at the time I think I saw it more clearly when I was separated from him I told you about being in Japan with him I told you that I was quite surprised shaken when we arrived at Haneda with all these people who had gathered from various parts of Japan to welcome him We arrived  my recollection is late at night  and they had come there twice because Id made a mistake about the dateline And he just walked right through this group of people didnt stop greet anybody and didnt say anything to anybody And I told you about Fukudaya they had made reservations for us at Fukudaya which was a very lovely old house that had been given to a courtesan by a Samurai and had been made in to small inn Japanesespeaking only When we arrived at Haneda going through immigration I was asked where we were going to be in and I said Fukudaya and the man said How do you know about that So it was a most special thing but even without that as I said  all these people I would guess they were a minimum of twenty twentyfive I excused it on the grounds that he was so emotionally stirred up at returning to Japan after fifty years that he couldnt do any better than that  Restraint of feelings  Yes exactly So he was a stubborn old fellow  Yes there also seems to have been a rebellious streak in him in his attitude towards establishment Zen  Yes there surely was   And did that make him appealing How did the people respond to that Because it seems now that in the biographical sketches that you read about him they always talk about that and in the way he opposed the Zen establishment he tried to be the true man with no rank He abhorred all titles but what you said yesterday about him thinking that you had gone to Japan  To share with him   Yes that makes it look a little bit different it puts a different light on it Well it surely puts a different light on lots of things Apparently Doctor Suzuki had been given not an honorarium but some sort of recognition for his work in spreading Zen throughout the world and when Senzaki Sensei went to Japan Doctor Suzuki gave him a thousand dollars to use on the trip Well when we arrived and went right north to Aomori which is where he had his little kindergarten we stopped off briefly at Matsushima and he insisted on eating oysters I think that was his first meal off the plane late at night and of course he became very ill But what did the rascal do When he was in Aomori he handed over those thousand dollars to these people as if he wanted to say See what I am see what I have Im sure he didnt mention Suzuki I dont know but I feel confident that he didnt and it really shook me up Also its interesting toward the end of our trip we were given a luncheon at one of the monasteries in Kyoto  I dont remember which one  and there was a man there by the name of Ogata and I remembered that an Ogata had been sent one time before I knew Senzaki Sensei to Senzaki Sensei as a kind of aid and helper to him in the United States Well that didnt last anytime at all Ogata went back to Japan and at this luncheon he said  and Im sure no one at the table missed hearing it In a general sense Senzaki has a very strange idea of money and the handling of money And I realized that this as certainly exact He did indeed not only because of the thing Ive just cited but Aitken speaks about how after one of these talks Senzaki Sensei would go around and gather up a lot of these leaves Great thats fine You know this plus the fact that Shubin Tanahashi paid the rent of where he lived plus the fact that at the Miyako Hotel he was given the rent outright should have provided him with quite a little roll to disperse  In Like a Dream Like a Fantasy I read what he wanted to be his epitaph he also gave a few other dispositions such as that his manuscripts should be edited by Kangetsu  thats you  and a certain Shoho  Shoho did he say Thats not a familiar name to me  Yes it says here I wish Soensan to take care of the English manuscripts too consulting with Kangetsu and Shoho in the same manner as with the Japanese ones Shoho I just  I dont know who that could be I have no memory of that name Gunther Might even be someone in Japan that Soen Roshi knew  Okay and there are also some poems here that he translated of a thirteenthcentury Japanese Zen Master named Jakushitsu Whats the last name  Jakushitsu There are several poems in here that he must have translated into English He did a lot with me Youll probably find a number of them in the cupboard next to my desk on this side It was very difficult to get him to do any work Id go down and say Lets do such and such Oh yes Kangetsu hed say no hurry lets have some tea So we had some tea and something else would come up  In terms of this dynamic that you talked about with Barbara Courtney she said that in your life you attracted men who wanted to exert their power over you Was there anything of that sort in your relationship with Senzaki Sensei Oh he certainly wanted to exert power I dont believe and I have to take a good long look at this perhaps  I dont know I dont feel that any of that was in our relationship I do know that when I came to Senzaki Sensei and Zen I really dug my heels in with John because when I wanted to continue my work at Twentieth Century Fox with Reginald Berkeley it went by the board immediately upon my marriage So this time I would not budge I never talked about it and I certainly didnt flaunt it and I never read any books at the time that John would be around so that I didnt annoy him but I refused to budge  So when did you say you went up to Northern California When did you live Pasadena 1956 I believe or early 57  So basically the most intense part of your relationship with Senzaki Sensei was right at the beginning before he went to Heart Mountain Yes it was in the forties from January 1941 I believe I said through to March of 42 when the remaining Japanese were rounded up and sent to camps So that was also the period where you were pregnant with Duncan and when he was born  Yes thats right and Duncan became known as my Zen baby So Duncan was born in October 41 Right And in December there was Pearl Harbor and you were given your Buddhist name  Right just the day before the sixth The day before Yes the sixth But let me tell you what happened on the seventh There was this most wonderful young woman the first person I ever employed staying with us in this little house way up Benedict Canyon She came in and told me that the Japanese had bombed Pearl Harbor and I said Oh dont pay any attention to those news theyll be contradicting it next thing Of course they didnt and of course the Japanese had indeed blasted Pearl Harbor But you know the thing that bothers me you see Rosy as I call FDR wanted to get us into the war we wouldnt get leaning way back and he was already helping to convoy ships to Londonderry which irritated a lot of us And then there was a white paper that came out that rnade the statement that FDR knew very definitely about the possible attack and had actually somehow provoked it by an earlier attack that we made out in the Orient Of course that all gets lost in the mists of time but I think thats correct I think it was quite deliberately done to get us angry and get us moving Was there any ritual any ceremony connected with your name Did you make any vows Well there was the Shujo Muhen Seigan Do Then he gave me what I recall is like a little rosary  I dont know where it is now it was  wooden made of seeds of some sort and it was very very early in the morning It was wintertime and it was dark and night when I arrived at his house  Had you asked to be given a Buddhist name No no it was just part of it He gave me that name Kangetsu Winter Moon because I had arrived on his doorstep in the winter It was very simple I suppose we had a bit of tea afterwards but I dont remember and I drove home And the next day Janis went down and got her Buddhist name  a wonderful woman   What was her last name Her last name when I first knew her was Alcorn and then she left us during the war and went back and became a BAM a woman marine and she married a marine at Campus Lejeune Before the war I had been taking judo at this great big dojo few miles away from my home I would go over one night a week I loved it Janis began taking it too when she joined me She got back to Campus Lejeune and there was a picnic one day with her group and another group including a warrant officer who made a couple of passes at her After the first one she said Dont do that again and of course he did do it again She threw him over her shoulder and everyone was absolutely aghast because he landed flat Oon his back in front of all these people At any rate they then appointed her to teach others in the Marines judo And I remember one time when I was first taking it John thought I was just a breadth this side of idiocy and he said not one of those could stand up against a good boxer I didnt argue it We had a lovely little garden in our little house and a little pond and I was standing looking at it one afternoon standing in the lawn when John came down on the lawn John was quite an athlete in college and took me up as a person would be taken up in the football game you know cutting in behind the knees I went down with a bump When I got up I said Dont ever do that again But of course in less than five minutes it happened again And when I got up I put a judo hold on him He was furious he couldnt brake it and he went in he banged the door so hard on our little house that it just about broke the house down But later during the war I remember him saying to a friend of ours who had signed up and was commander of a little PT boat out in the Pacific What about this judo stuff there is nothing to that is there And Frank said Dont ever get into a tangle with anybody who knows judo There is a lot to it And he said We all get trained in some of it  John never gave me the benefit of the fact that he had that information but anyway  Well it would have given you power Oh yes and confidence certainly more confidence  of a sort But now good heavens I dont know the percentages but I would say at least a quarter of the young women today know judo or karate  So did you see Senzaki Sensei as frequently after he came back from Heart Mountain as you had the first year Well as you know he came directly to our home and he was there for about six weeks We had moved to Pasadena at that time and had a big wonderful rambling old house Actually I think that I saw more of him because my children were a little bit older and they would be in the school which was in the neighborhood until two oclock I never wanted Keith or Duncan to come to an empty house when they got home I always managed to be there so I could give them some juice a cookie or something So yes Id say that I saw more of him And of course he got a place at the Miyako Hotel afterwards and then from Shubin Tanahashi this wonderful duplex I say wonderful because it was large with airy room lots of sunlight and relative quiet for the area You know really FDR was a megalomaniac Imagine incarcerating all these people in these terrible camps freezing in winter broiling in summer and in the meantime conscripting their sons into the Army into the Navy whatever Some of the Japanese Franko told us were in the Navy  of course most people didnt know there were any in the Navy But theyd come in close to an island they thought was occupied by the Japanese the volunteers who went in were always the JapaneseAmericans who knew full well that if they were picked up by the Japanese theyd be killed and if there weren any they would be killed by the Americans who came on the island Because they were Japanese   This afternoon we listened to the tape by Barbara Courtney and she was talking about this legacy that you were going to leave behind in writing We both agreed that it would be a little bit difficult for you to do it in writing so lets just try to do it now on tape She said there were things that needed to come through and you too were talking about this stream of consciousness things that would just pour out I guess Right I feel Gunther that so many things come through to me and in retrospect they seem to have been pretty accurate I feel this very essential for a person of intelligence particularly and sensitivity if that person feels that he or she wishes to do something and I mean it isnt a whim then I think very definitely against all odds it doesnt necessarily mean its going to be easy but it is going to be satisfying Of course Im speaking from my background which goes back a long long way and is very different from peoples backgrounds today Also as you know I dont believe in death anymore that in a giving up of the body Beyond that as far as I am concerned there is no death whatsoever And I told you about that remarkable experience I had in Florence with Vanda and Laura Corsini   Yes but could you repeat it please because I never wrote it down Well you may know in Florence there is a restaurant that serves only lunch And everything except the salt and pepper on the table is grown on the Antinori farm Vanda had taken me and Laura Corsini to lunch there Here they had turned what I believe was originally a ballroom into the restaurant there were just very few tables and upstairs there were three tables So I sat here next to me was Vanda and just on the other side of her was Laura Corsini and Vanda was talking to her Ordinarily I listen to peoples conversations when I am in another country simply as a means of learning the language but on this particular occasion I wasnt paying any attention because Vanda had  her head turned away from me and Laura was on the other side of her So all of a sudden I became aware of a very strong fragrance of roses very strong There were flowers on our table there were flowers on the next table down I looked over the edge down below flowers there too  but no roses But this was simply unmistakable very heavy After a few moments Vanda turned to me and said You know Laura is a follower of Padre Pio and I remembered reading about him and said Well you know Ive been looking around trying to find where the fragrance of roses came from That was the experience And in the past before that quite a while before I would occasionally get a strong fragrance of some flowers or something but fragrances just fragrances This was different though I think that they are all alike in some way  Did you have other experiences where you strongly felt something coming through Im sorry I am sort of confused right now because I find a lot of things coming in at me Ive had experiences where it was fragrances I had experiences oh it sounds impossible like a touch quite frequently and   You mentioned you once had the impression that Senzaki Sensei was touching you  Yes And another friend of mine who passed away on Christmas Day years and years ago I often felt that she was touching me And in a couple of occasions I was just turning involuntarily I dont know how those things come about because I dont know what would be touching I mean its so ephemeral so I dont know  Well what you said before about doing what one feels the impulse to do is one piece of wisdom that you found this time around What other things have you learned have you found that you think come out of the experience of this lifetime You know one thing that used to bother me was that To thine own self be true follows the night the day And I thought How did one know what his own self was And I think Gunther for me the finding of that not the analyzing or description of it was in meditation I feel that for me meditation opens up everything and it can be a bit dangerous because out there there are lots of things we dont know about lots of them and they are not all friendly Also I feel that as a person takes his direction the things that happen along the way on either side are strong contributors to learning I dont know who I am But Im sure without a shadow of a doubt that I have lived other times and most of them all of them in the northern hemisphere and most of them in ancient civilizations  And I noticed when Duncan was a little boy he was much more interested in ancient civilizations than in more modern ones than I certainly was as a child I would also enjoy knowing where we met before because we certainly have been associated somewhere along the line in some way  What else is there that would be part of this legacy Well I believe Ive touched on this already didnt I First of all I feel it is most important if a person has a real urge to do something  and in my case it happened to be writing  and it feels absolutely right then he should do it Another case was the purchase of a property I could have done I made a dreadful mistake not getting it because the place where it was was a wonderful little community way down south and only four blocks were zoned for business So it was fantastic The person who was selling it wanted quick money so that he could go up and open up the place now known as Squaw Valley a ski area I could have got it relatively for a song So I think when a person feels strongly as I did about the writing and later about this property  and it is the only property I can recall even feeling quite this way about it just seemed absolutely right then I feel a person should follow that do it and if its the right thing wonderful If its not exactly right hell soon find it out and there is a lesson So I feel that it is a one hundred percent winwin proposition you cant lose Now to remember this as I make the transition and I turn in my suit of course Im not absolutely sure what Im going to do  it seems that different people choose to do different things in different ways but as I see it Ill probably be coming back before very long to mop up all the undone things   Youll be a lot more assertive next time around Yes I would I would not be so easily dissuaded If I should draw the same father and the same situation I dont know quite how I would handle that because as I said I was trained to instant obedience I did rebel later on but   This brings to mind one thing Youve been living here for fifteen years and in these fifteen years you were divorced or anyway living separate from your husband so you were on your own your sons were adults grown up and independent so what stopped you from starting to write Im thinking of Harriet Doerr whose book Consider this Senora Oh yes she was a friend of mine  Yes you told me and it is a wonderful book one of the best Ive read last year She wrote that book I think when she was late in her seventies or even in her eighties Yes and its very interesting the way it came about because she was in my class in school in fact she lived in my house Harriet had transferred from Smith  she and another girl in my house  and left school I would say probably about her second year to go abroad with a relative ostensibly to choose a trousseau  she was going to marry a Stanford man whom I knew darling person but also accident prone   Yes you told me the story about Acapulco Yes right but a wonderful person Then Harriet came back to Stanford ostensibly to complete her degree  And her maiden name was Huntington Yes right I would say the Huntington Her home was what is now the Huntington Library So Harriet came back to finish her education and came across Wallace Stagner who was teaching creative writing in Portland I never knew him I told you about Edith Mirrielees my favorite professor who founded the Creative Writing Department at Stanford It was she who brought Wallace Stagner to Stanford Well Harriet discovered him and somehow or other started to write and was quite successful with her first book Stones for Ibarra  Yes but Stones for Ibarra came out in the eighties ten or twelve years ago That was long after she went to Stanford probably fifty years after You mean the first time She went back to finish her education after her husband died That was when she came across Wallace Stagner So why didnt I Well one reason I didnt actually I did but I wanted to travel and I traveled a great deal I made fourteen trips to Europe and one to Japan Artd once to Europe I would stay over there Once I stayed a month that was the shortest After that I was surely five months six months one time it was one year I was going to live there I decided to move there I came back for Keiths marriage and then I decided that after all I was a Westerner and then I worked it the other way Id just live here and travel to Europe So thats how that came about but that still doesnt answer the writing business but somehow by that time the drive to write had lessened considerably so I didnt I did other things that satisfied me  You always say that you had these two major interests the writing and what you call your religion Were you able to pursue the latter to the extent that you wanted are you satisfied with how far you were able to go  Yes the interesting thing is the only writing I did was in the religious field I mean at Senzaki Senseis request Buddhism and Zen and then The Iron Flute Of course if you look at the cover of The Iron Flute you wonder who in the world has anything to do with this potpourri of names Thats it I wrote a lot of letters to friends that I wanted to renew connections with I really dont know at this date more than those things that I have mentioned  But let me focus a little bit better on my question you said you were not able to pursue your interest in writing but you were able to pursue your interest in religion You see that was connected with John Because I told him those were the two things And I was working at Twentieth Century Fox and we had no phone We lived in this little weekend house made of beaver board literally and almost immediately he told me I would have to stop my job at Twentieth Century which I loved and where I was learning learning a lot And of course again hindsight sometimes being 2020 vision I would not allow him to lay down the law that he laid down few weeks after our marriage on the writing And I thought at the time and it certainly proved correct later I started off at forty dollars a week and every month every four weeks that was to be raised ten dollars up until I forgot what the final number was but for those days it was astronomical John was earning 125 a month its as simple as that And I thought This is the male ego I heard so much about And later of course thats what it turned out to be in its most virulent form I would say  But you did not let him stop you from pursuing your interest in religion No thats right Ive done one and I was not going to put them both down thats absolutely right and if Id just done the same thing with the writing he might have capitulated Of course if we hadnt been married it would have been a very good thing I mean there again hindsightinsight I married John primarily because I felt very sorry for him he was going through a very bad patch he and his family and naturally I shouldnt have done that Later it made a lot of sense to me when Vanda said one time If you want to help somebody go in and help then get out You dont have to make a longlife thing of it  But looking back now are you content are you satisfied with how far you were able to go in your pursuit of religion Personally yes Im satisfied yes  No regrets there  No and also no Zen no Krishnaji none of those things and no Brugh Joy Its just  somebody chooses to call it religion and I feel that is very wide certainly universal You know people running around and Sunday school children putting in their dime so they can convert the heathen  First of all they dont know anything about what heathen religions are Secondly even if heathen religions are as they suppose they might be its okay I think everybody does what he must at the point where he stands When thats no longer the right thing for him he will see it and move on Sylvia is a perfect example She is in a real dichotomy between Sylvia and her belief system Now I dont touch it but one of these days it will hit her she will see it for herself maybe not in my lifetime I dont think But I feel when a person is sincere it doesnt matter whether he is praying to the nymph in a tree or a dryad on a tree or to a monotheistic god or just in general I feel as long as there is sincerity and feeling in that and he is not asking for something for himself  me me me me me  then it doesnt matter The prayer is there it does what it does it combines thats it in my view  With that in mind what are your observations about the spread of Zen in the United States You saw it from the very beginning when Zen was basically limited to a very small group of people of which you were a part to which you belonged and now there are probably tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands of followers  There was really not even a small group There were few Japanese and that was it  Well it has certainly come a long way   Yes it certainly has come a surprisingly long way Well I think its fine I think that it went through a period  it may still be there I dont know because I havent followed it close enough lately  of feeling that any ridiculous statement was a koan with no understanding of the nature of a koan And all this business that Tricycle brings up you know Buddhism is this and Buddhism is that to me thats incorrect but if thats their way of looking at it thats their way  So what would be the correct way if its possible to give a positive definition To say that its not correct is a negative definition  Its difficult but there would be no path no footprints no groups  ff  But probably there still needs to be an element of teaching of passing on these guidelines  But that doesnt require a group No not necessarily in my experience there were times when I belonged to a group especially when I was down in Tempe there was a little Zen group We met once a week to do zazen together and once or twice a year a senior monk or once even the Roshi came from Los Angeles and we had a little sesshin an intensive weekend or threeday meditation But since then I really have never belonged to any group anymore for one thing because I traveled so much and was living in different places and recently because where I am there is no group Im more or less the only one and its okay I just remember that in the times when I was in a group somehow the group also provided a kind of support Maybe I would meditate more or it would give me a kind of energy of support to persist in this And certainly it pushed me a little bit farther than I would have gone on my own Well you know more about that than I do you see because the fact is that I never was in a group and always my relationship was first of all alone completely alone and then with Senzaki Sensei and that was it And occasionally another person would come in like after the war Bob Aitken and so forth but that was also how some of the funny stories got started There was a woman who started coming  I saw her only two or three times at most  I think her name was Ruth Molden At any rate she is responsible for putting out some of the strangest material on me and what Zen was like under Senzaki Sensei And it went into The Wind Bell which Baker had up in San Francisco  of course hes gone now from there  and it sort of got to be the accepted version I think it may even be in How the Swans Came to the Lake or whatever it is And you know Duncan wrote to Rick and never even received an answer That annoyed him because I always put in everybody but my name was never mentioned That bothers Duncan bless his heart I guess thats the price you pay for not belonging to any group Nobody knows you or about you  Well of course I was down there and yes I suppose so But some of the ones I do know about dont know very much Just as I was telling you you know in Tricycle they just land him up at the Miyako Hotel onetwothree but that was very late in his being in California    This brings to mind one of the things that you told me quite some time ago maybe ten years ago that for you all the religious teachings boil down to two things awareness and appreciation Right because to me the appreciation is very much a heartthing and the awareness of course is the preliminary to the appreciation But I think I told you also about my feelings about the different religions in the world yes even such things as pantheistic and nature religions My feeling about it  I dont know just when it started  is that its allinclusive and it doesnt matter what kind of name is put to it as long as the person is deeply sincere and honest  It makes it seems very ridiculous that there have been so many religious wars in the course of history Well it certainly does You remember that wonderful medieval story The devil and a man were walking down the street together and the man said Well I suppose finally youre getting a little bit worried at what we are doing with our beliefs in our church Then the devil said Why should I be worrying The man says Well look at all the people who are gathering to it and look how its catching on And the devil said Yes but I still dont see any need to worry You know last week they began to organize Did you ever see that marvelous British picture Dudley Moore played the human being in it  Was it Bedazzled If you ever get a chance you will enjoy it There is this man Dudley Moore and very normally he wants this and that and so forth and the devil appears to him one day And the only way you can tell the devil in the film is because he has red socks  The devil says Ill give you ten wishes All you have to do is to blow this raspberry and Ill be there and then youll get a wish Dudley Moore tried it out the devil immediately responded but it was a sort of a tryout So it goes throughout the whole picture There are these various situations and in each of them Dudley Moore forgets some strategic bit some important part of it So what comes out is very amusing and finally he gets to his last wish He blows the raspberry and nothing happens and he blows it again and nothing happens and the devil goes You already did that right in the beginning when you were trying it out So thats the finish of it    Anything else that you would include in your legacy Anything else that you would write down Of course the awareness and the appreciation we just mentioned and  Well for me Gunther you know keep pretty well out of organized anything institutions and anything like that I mean that is mine but I mean that suits you or somebody else The only thing I belong to now is the Humane Society which I feel is very important I also feel that its incumbent on all people who are deeply sincere and love life love animals to pour as much of that as possible into the atmosphere because there is still a frightening amount of outandout sadism really frightening and I mean as close as within the San Mateo borders unbelievable   Why do you think that is Why A lot of people feel that its because theres so much violence on TV Ive been told I dont know whether its a fact or not but that afternoonTV is really bad and thats when children come home from school to an empty house and sit down and watch TV Well okay thats a The other part of watching TV and this to my mind applies to adults as well many of them is that theyre always spectators they are never in it its not a part of their lives what they see theyre always seeing it off the screen so that nothing has a real validity its something to be watched like an accident rushing around to see whos hurt and how badly and so forth  and not because they care although of course there are people who care dont mistake me I just feel this is a spectators business turning everybody into spectators Nothing is real and really affects people  Well but in a way this seems a contradiction of what you said before if people watch violence on television and if it did not affect them then why should they become violent in their own lives So in some way it must be affecting them if they then become violent in their own lives I think that a lot of the violence that has been brought about by certain activists who are acting deliberately and the drug bit Here they have little gradechildren nine and ten years old posted to watch and give warning while drugs are being exchanged And you know what you and I saw right down near the San Mateo station I think that has an awful lot to do with it  In terms of violence in Tv last night after you went to bed I turned on the Tv I wanted to see a news program and so I went through the various channels and it  was amazing almost everywhere there was the most gory violence not cavalier things not Agatha Christie or detective stories but really gory stuff I turned it off It was nine thirty or ten oclock and there wasnt anything more intelligent on prime time TV than this really awful stuff  But to go back to violence in society do you think there is some kind of karmic thing that is being worked out there It seems that there is almost a breakdown in societies in all these inhibitory qualities that culture has I think there is another and more important factor The consciousness and the emphasis on the consciousness have certainly shifted I mean the very fact that we were talking about how Zen has changed from an unknown nothing and also people  for example when I was growing up and I was a young woman to say that somebody was psychic was just really waving a red flag except possibly to a few people And now its accepted people are psychic and theyre making studies on it It used to be thought that people with insight were sort of village fools and oh my goodness a number of years ago Id say twentyfive anyway some studies were made and it was learned that far from being the village fools the people who are psychic with insight have very high intelligence And these studies cited several examples in the army or among engineers that were So that was quite a surprise  And what do you think is going to happen as a consequence of this change in awareness Well I think that one main part of it is moving over So that large groups of people who have these insights will be working together not necessarily in an institutionlike way but eventually of course according to Weiss everybody has got to come through some just take longer than others but I think that this is a big period for that opening up When they talk about the New Age theyre probably wiser than they know I think it will be a New Age in consciousness   Do you have any hunch when it will start  or has it already started Oh I think it has I think very definitely it has started and maybe not on such a wide scale but its a sort of fanning out just as I gave the example a short time ago of Zen thats a very good example And I think generally there is more tolerance in religion and Im not speaking only of the Judaic religions  Judaism Christianity and Islam but I think all of them Of course this doesnt mean that everybody is just going to get a rubber stamp that he is very good and highly evolved but there will be a lot of them around  And what changes will that bring on a collective level I dont know even in economy or politics or international relations  Well I think there will be more cohesion among nations I started to say that there will be less nationalism but Im not so sure about that I think that still has quite a little long ways to go  In Europe certainly Yes people keep talking about how small the world is now and it is But there is still lot of moping up to be done China is an example human rights  Years ago it could be 79 there was lot of talk about California sinking into the ocean and some people took it so seriously They went up to high ground and waited for us to sink At that time I was down at Sky Hi in the Mojave Desert with the first session that I had with Brugh And someone spoke to him about this and he said Well I think the emphasis is all in the wrong place The New Age is going to bring a new consciousness and it has nothing to do with California sinking into the ground Californians may be a big part of it which reminds me didnt you get a chuckle out of Brian Weiss saying that he decided to meditate the way that people did in Indian California Well anyway As I say with the earthquake shaking around and everything with all its faults I love it still  You have been living pretty close to the fault line for quite some time  Oh yes thats right All my life practically as long as Ive been in California yes Of course when Im in Europe I live on other fault lines on the line of winds or something Yes I certainly have To go back to the shift in consciousness as I said to you Zen is an example or the acceptance of people being psychic You cant imagine the  at least mentally  curled lip of someone listening to talk about somebody being psychic And I think its great I think its lot of fun and Im certainly very very happy to have lived in the century that I lived and Ive seen so many things as I told you I remember standing on the street corner of Fourteenth and Webster holding my mothers hand watching the fire engines thunder by with their beautiful horses and their Dalmatians standing up between the firemen and of course these things were a long time ago And of course there is always what the Greeks called Hubris and Nemesis There is always that  Did you have experiences youd call psychic  I think I have yes I dont know that I ever told you but I knew when I was a child not more than ten years old that I had what I would now refer to perhaps as a minor mission I remember drying dishes for my mother  which would mean it was morning because she never did them at night just rinse them  and I was telling her what I wanted to do And I told her I wanted to write and to be a missionary That was the only word I knew And my parents didnt belong to a church  You got them slightly worried No I dont think so But from this distance or even earlier I see that missionary was literally the only word I knew to describe what I wanted to do which was to reach people through what I would call religion I dont like that word either but you know what I mean Channeling I guess is about the closest thing to it because in that there is no personality and it just flows along And Im sure Ive mentioned to you that in the past sometimes something will came up and I would say something I havent thought about And I suddenly realized that what Ive said was correct And it wasnt I it was what I now call channeling coming through me And Carolyn Conger  I think Ive mentioned her to you before  told me once a long time ago Ruth that was a magnificent koan and of course it was channeled I dont know what it was I dont remember any koan at any session with her and other members but anyway I remember her saying that And I do know also that I pick up peoples thoughts quite frequently and Im not necessarily aware of it at the time  Well there are two things that come to my mind about that one is an experience I once had when I was in Japan I remember riding the bus in Kyoto I think it was going north on Marutamachi and there was a class of schoolchildren or kindergarten children on it They were very tiny and they all wore a yellow uniform and a yellow hat At a certain stop they all got off the bus I stayed on the bus the doors were still open I looked down on the floor and there was a pair of yellow gloves Without thinking I just bent down picked them up and threw them through the open door out to one of the children Then I saw that outside the bus a little girl was going around looking for her gloves And it occurred to me only afterward that I hadnt be doing any thinking I had just acted spontaneously Right right it just happened   It just happened yes and I labeled it a Zen experience in the sense that there was no I there was no ego no thinking but I was attuned to the situation and did the right thing spontaneously without rationalizing or thinking what I should do or so I just did it it was just being in the moment  Right yes And isnt it wonderful to be in that atmosphere  Yes it is   Could you please tell me more about your experience with regards to channeling Did you ever hear about the Betty Books by Stewart Edward White  You gave me one The Job of Living Yes okay Well I think I told you after Ive read the books Ive found out that they lived right up here or had lived right up here Betty had no idea of any of this and one night a group of them was at a party she and her husband among them Someone had brought a Ouija board and they stopped using the little Ouija thing that moves around and used I think an inverted whisky glass or something of this sort Well it rocketed around and it kept asking for Betty Well Betty thought somebody was just being very funny Finally Ive forgot what the upshot of the party was finally I guess she did go over and do something and the little whisky glass quieted down and seemed very content Stewart Edward White thought he would just try an experiment with Betty  this was at home She would be lying down and he would just touch her wrist  there is something that Ive lost in here I guess he was asked to do it  anyway And he said well he would do it as long as there was no harm in any way to Betty I believe that for the rest of her life she and he did this for at least an hour no matter what was going on in their life and they had very busy lives because they traveled a lot had lots of friends as a matter of fact their home was referred to as the White Hotel He tells one interesting little incident in there that he would touch her wrist and she would go into a kind of trance because when she came out she had no recollection of what had been said but he put everything down And one time I learned that oh I came across something where he had written that his address was Burlingame Well that was before Hillsboro was Hillsboro actually they lived in what we now call Hillsboro and I was having dinner with some friends in Hillsboro one evening and the subject came out about Betty White and I said Did you ever know her And my friend Kate said Yes indeed  she said  many a time she sat right in that chair having dinner with us as you are having it to night She was a very small person really tiny she would never allow herself to be measured but her husband insisted that she wasnt even five feet tall They were back east in Washington DC one time when  51  Theodore Roosevelt was president Theodore and Stewart Edward White wrote that Roosevelt said when he saw Betty I dont believe it  Really Yea She had many abilities She had been reared I believe she was an orphan and had been reared by an aunt of her some relative and he said she loved gardens and she had a very large garden  and she would just map out on a big sheet of brown paper with their one gardener how she wanted to arrange things and he said that always it was just beautiful And in another occasion he said they were up in the mountains and there was a bear there that amused her and he said she just made a quick sketch of just a few lines and caught the humor of this bear I mean apparently she was multitalented  So to go back from where we started on this tangent or off this tangent when you use the word channeling you were not referring to that type of channeling You mean psychic type being out and not knowing  Well yes out and some other entity speaking through oneself No not at all  I mean this was not Betty speaking it was somebody speaking through Betty Thats right no absolutely not I dont know where mine comes from but I find there is an impersonality about that its just as I believe I mentioned to you that workshop with the man who was having difficulties and my wording  and I wasnt aware of it until much later when I listened to the tape  my wording was As I was going down it came to me that as you do such and such  purely impersonal nothing I mean Ive thougµt such and such I feel such and such no nothing like that And I think really as I can feel at the moment at least I feel that all my channeling is that way its impersonal which does not mean that I may not say I think such and such after its over the fact  you get it   Talking about my experiences in channeling with other people I do remember one time I was at a workshop of Carolyn Congers and it lasted I believe a week or two weeks something of that sort and at the very last Carolyn had us pair off and pick up anything that we could What just happened is that I was paired with a young woman I didnt happen to feel much rapport with but I started out I could see the approach to her unit  she lived in an apartment building  and inside then I described the furniture I described first where she liked to sit her position and I went on from there a bit and then someone approached her door and I said it was her mother and I described her mother and I described her mothers dress At this point the only thing I remember about that is that I said it was unbelted and hung perfectly straight Well it just apparently happened that everything that I said in that she said it was absolutely correct   Thats amazing I think it is because it isnt I It isnt I it just is there   And has that whatever it is also given you advice on how to act or how to behave in certain situations in your life Yes in different times absolutely and I learned if I didnt pay attention things went awry and if I did pay attention it was quite different  Do you recall any example Well I recall a negative example Little Keith was about four years old My father the major professor lived up north  we lived in Pasadena  and had a cabinet up at Fallen Leaf Lake which is contiguous to Tahoe the southern end of which was undoubtedly a part of Tahoe and he wanted John and me to come up And he said hed like us to bring Keith Well I just didnt think it was the right thing for  53  whatever reason and I dont know that I expressed it It didnt seem right to me something was wrong Okay but we go and we take Keith My father paid practically no attention to him and of course the full burden of Keiths care and entertainment and so forth was on me and in other words it was no vacation for me And when we got home little Duncan who was two Janis who was a wonderful person she was the first person that I ever employed and she was with me a few weeks before Keith was born and afterwards she came back before Duncan was born  anyway she had stayed with Duncan and she said that when Duncan woke up and found that we were gone she said he just upchucked everything And little Duncan sat there we were all  we had a great big pantry  we were all having something to eat there in the pantry and he rocked back and forth in his chair Im going to go on a tchip Im not going to take anybody else with me Im just going to go on a tchip well it had hurt him deeply and as I said I had had no vacation Thats a negative example But so often I could find this which made it difficult I would feel something and say something But the reaction was What makes you think that How could that be You cannot explain and if you do its just worse than anything because then its irrational to some people illogical certainly  well thats it  Would it be possible to quantify how often that would occur Was it something rare or was it frequent or was it more frequent at the times and then less at others I cant answer that question Gunther not accurately  Was there any method to this madness You sound like the people who would question me It didnt seem to be and I cant tell you at all whether it was more frequent sometimes than others I would guess that it was but I cant say accurately  And so you cannot even say why whatprompted it or if there was anything any kind of causal connection that could have prompted it   Well I cant answer that accurately All I can say is that I do know that if I expressed it at all it was immediately beaten down because it was so obviously illogical and from my part if I didnt follow it I paid When I did everything it wasnt necessarily easy but went well  On those occasions on which you did express it and you were later proven true did that have any effect on those people who first tried to deride you You mean did they ever care about it Is that what youre saying  Well if later it turned out that you were right illogical and irrational though it may have been  No no I should say not  No because there was my mother who also sometimes has this we call it the sixth sense she could just sense something and she couldnt say why  Mm  mm thats right  Hunches I guess is another way of calling it And when they were on their honeymoon they were driving through Europe and in Belgium one morning my mother woke up and she had a very strong feeling sensation that something was going to happen to them that day and she really tried to dissuade my father from driving that day And he didn t take her seriously and in fact they had a severe accident and they totaled the car Nothing happened to them but the car was totaled This was back in the fifties and I dont know what kind of insurance but anyway it was a major blow apart from the fact that it rudely interrupted their honeymoon But after that my father had a lot of respect for these   promptings  Yes of my mother because she certainly proved true she was proved true by the events I never gained any respect I mean each time was new and each time I was way out in left field  except for myself I mean I as I said Ive soon learned and I did follow everything and went along When I didnt there was difficulty And has either one of your sons inherited this special antenna Well I dont know we have never talked about it I had an idea at one time that Keith had But Im not sure thats correct now of course these things can become overlaid Oh certainly I think Duncan has a form of it and I think my mother had a form of it In what sense Duncan is very quick about people picking things up on people I mean I remember he came into this building two or three years ago and when he got up to me he said You know your new manager could  cook the books He had just barely glanced at her Now no one has ever caught her cooking the books but I would say that our fees have gone up and up and up not only because of her but she had a lot to do with it and I just  Thats the kind of thing with Duncan Duncan knows almost immediately about certain people and he told me rather to my surprise recently that he likes everybody Well Duncan is pretty strongminded I cant quite imagine that you know I mean he has certain standards that not necessarily apply to everybody It has been very difficult for me to learn for example that a person can be extremely pleasant charming and be just a bad actor  Your mother also had these psychic abilities  Yes she did She was very quick about people and she had with it  there was never any bitterness there was always a little chuckle with it of amusement but she was very quick to pick things up on people I mean to see what they really indicated I think that Duncan has more that type than perhaps Keith but I dont know because Keith has really for the most part clammed up an awful lot since his marriage and of course he is not married now but it has still affected him I believe  And do you think you can do something to cultivate these abilities Yes Im sure of it But also I was conditioned years and years ago by the Eastern approach that says you know dont try to cultivate them because these things will appear naturally as you move along and if you try to cultivate them then you have to stop you may have to go back and you know so forth So I deliberately avoided that And at a workshop of Carolyn Congers someone asked me about that Why are you afraid of it I said Im not afraid Carolyn was right there and as I explained the other person and Im sure Carolyn also understood  And did it in fact happen that as you went along with meditation that it came naturally The one example you gave the one with Keith this was a long time ago so you were barely at the beginning of your experience  Well it was in my thirties   Keith wasnt born until I was thirty   But you were at the beginning of your involvement with Zen with Eastern traditions werent you Duncan was born in 41  when was Keith born Keith was born actually in 39  Sl  1939 so this was before you met Senzaki  Yearight  So in that sense I thought you were barely at the beginning Did it seem to you that as you meditated as you went more deeply into Zen and the Eastern approach that did actually come  Im just trying to think when it was that I really went over to the Eastern approach First of all I can say it was a solid year from the beginning of the Zen when I really made up my mind to the end and I remember way way back when I was probably about eight or nine years old It was a very overcast day and I guess it must have been some sort of vacation or a Saturday or something I went out to our mailbox its just one of those regular mailboxes you know you pull it down and shove it up When I went out and it made its usual sound  but there was something about that sound that from years later when I came across it in Zen I recognized  I dont know   Well in a way you havent answered my question You said you were told that in the Eastern tradition you dont pursue these abilities that as you develop they will come out naturally Well what I said then was you already had it before before you even started with the Eastern tradition This impunction not to pursue it actively but to just let it unfold naturally was that validated by your experience or not Did that actually happen as the years went by and you practiced Zen meditation and followed the Eastern way Yes I would say that it did Gunther but again this is in retrospect And at that time Im not even sure that at that time I was aware of them occurring I mean in any a sort of you know streak of lightning kind of thing not at all I think Ive told you earlier it took me a long time to begin to have confidence in these things And I dont know whether this is a sort of corollary or not but with it later I did find that as I mentioned to Barbara Courtney any wish of mine would be fulfilled almost instantly and I had to be very careful even not to admire things too much But along with that and I can give you exact examples for example being a visitor with the contemporary at Stanford she by this time was the presidents wife not the presidents the professors wife and across the street from them there was a visiting professor and his wife and she took me over one day just to meet them and I loved their color combination the rugs were a kind of wheat color and they had furniture which was blue and furniture which was green and so forth beautiful Well after our home was sold and I moved it just happened that the carpet on the floor in the apartment was wheat color and I came here the living room and hall  and dining room are all wheat color Well that kind of thing And I feel that there is a corollary  The colors in here are very pleasant I think so too yes I did change the carpeting in my bedroom because everything they had was blue but all the rest is just the way I found it except for these walls which were painted a flat black   Black Yes  Oh God Flat You know some decorators had gotten hold of them The person who helped me with for example with the upholstery on that sofa and the upholstery on this chair and ottoman and that chair was a friend of Duncans Each one had been to the others third birthday party and Tom now had become a designer and had access He was tireless He would bring down these samples and I truly   I think that the sofa and you know that strange color but look at this oriental carpet with it   Lets go back to what you said that when you grew up you wanted to write and be a missionary  Hm  hm   I can tell you something very humorous about that period  of time We lived in a little town and it had a triangular Plaza in the center it was an old town It had three churches a large Catholic church across the tracks  a small Methodist church that was just darling a little gray wooden structure and what delighted my heart was that the Christian Scientists met in an auditorium over the pharmacy  What was the name of the village Well it was San Leandro but you see it is not the San Leandro we know today thats why I avoided to name it because out of my bedroom window I looked for at least a mile of earth that back then might be plowed in spring and then planted with corn or with alfalfa or something   Artichokes  Not that one no But it went back to the creek and as I say the creek had water in it which meant little frogs in the springtime and immediately adjacent to that was this orchard with a row of cherry and a row of peach and a row of cherry and a row of peach It was just beautiful When I looked out my window I saw all this and then I also saw this sweep of hills and in springtime of course the hills were green Those were the hills that went up to Lake Chabot Back to the missionary my parents did not belong to a church they did not go to a church except for funerals and christenings occasionally and as I said I was about ten eleven at the most  I dont think I was quite that old though  and my mother had me in these big broadbrimmed hats theyd be panama in the summer with a wide ribbon around it and down the back elastic under the chin and then for winter a beaver with a wide black ribbon around it down the back elastic under the chin There was a boy in my class that really started up the heart palpitations I can remember going to Sunday school and of course I had to walk it was a mile each way and coming back toward home seeing Herbie Valens in the near distance with some of his cronies and I ducked into a shop took my hat off put the elastic up inside put the hat back down and walk past Herbie Oh the agony of that  I didnt get the point what does it have to do with the missionary I suppose just going to church   I see But I stopped going because I decided I would read my Bible and I started out and   Always the individualist You are right But also as so often happens with somebody who is just beginning something they are thrown off base by the slightest thing whereas if they plowed on theyd find something more perhaps Anyway in this instance I started to read my Bible and at Sunday school I asked Mrs Badal I said If Adam and Eve were the only couple in the world then whom did Cain marry I never went back to Sunday school again And of course as I read on in my Bible a wee bit  I cant imagine it was more than one page or two  it turned out that Cain married somebody from the the land of Nod Well if thats what he did then obviously Adam and Eve were not the first people on the planet Then of course many many years later I learned that during the Hebrew captivity in Mesopotamia the Hebrews took much of their  belief out of the Chaldean Of course the Chaldeans had their own script and I dont know when it was that the Hebrews got a script but I do know that well at least according to what Ive read on the ancient past in the Chaldean cosmology there was the equivalent of the Nordic Loki  his name was Enlio  who was always a mischief maker So when the earth was covered with vegetation Enlio went around and was pulling it up being a pest and  I dont even remember her name Ner Hensog said All right thats that Well the Gods become very upset and they finally persuaded her to come back and to put vegetation on the earth again And she said that if she did such a thing Enlio would have to be controlled Well she does come back and goes ahead with the vegetation then she gets to the prime development man and woman and in the Mesopotamian cosmology the name for woman and the name for rib are the same And so she gets there and she gets this rib from Enlio and according to the religion makes the woman and of course in Hebrew cosmology Adams rib is used to make woman And so all these things are it seems to me interrelated very cleverly and of course just to have a Father God seems a little bit unrealistic and yet I dont like it when they call you know some of the Christians do FatherMother God I guess Im way off course but I just dont happen to agree with an anthropomorphic God Which of course is very heavily the Judaic and the Christian religion and Islam And Ive told you since you have been here I absolutely fail to understand how two thousand years can pass with thousands of very intelligent people who say that they dislike the Jews because of what the Jews did to Jesus Jesus was a Jew Didnt that ever occur to anybody These are things that are simply beyond my understanding They truly are and Im not being dramatic when Im saying it I dont understand how it can be  I totally agree Do you remember I wrote my MA thesis on the parable and much of the research I used for reference was done on the parables of Jesus I didnt cover that because I thought thats already been said but I looked at other parables from the Old Testament all the way up to Kafka But it was very obvious that the parables of Jesus were in the Jewish tradition he didnt invent anything new he just used the methods and the tools that were available to him from his own tradition Didnt Duncan tell you about the book Holy Blood Holy Grail  He told me about it but I never read it I must say I think its very interestingextremely so It was written by these three men and one or two of them are British But I suppose here again is one of the reasons I was mentioning to you earlier today I felt that when a person is sincere and is not asking for some thing for himself it  didnt matter what his belief is I feel that goes out and becomes whatever it is  I still find it funny that as a girl you would say these things if you already knew as a girl what the main themes in your life would be Not that it was something exceptional in you I think very often it happens with children and when I was three years I also said I wanted to write and I also said I would go to the Wild West Well I did go to the Wild West and I guess Im not writing my own books or at least not yet but Im certainly as a translator in a way also writing Of course yes exactly   And nobody told me that it wasnt a suggestion from the outside it just came I couldnt even speak properly because I mispronounced the word for write but I wanted to write and I said I would go to the Wild West  And you knew it   And I knew it yes Yes well thats another reason why I feel that this business of turning in ones suit doesnt go very far  When someone dies he may come back he may not he may help in one way or help in another  So what does that say about the job of parents About the job of parents  In educating their children of course if they come with an agenda of their own Well I think first of all the parents dont know that the child has that I dont think the child mentions it or if he does very late and in a guise that the parent might not pick up right away There are still things that will help a child adapt to the worlds society I think it is primarily that and loving support and love for the child what the parent does  Or should do Yes thats right I know a number of years ago it was noted that a baby who was picked up and loved and held and so forth could be very intelligent That same baby put down and left pretty much in his crib with a bottle of milk across that or something like it occasionally didnt do so well I believe thats very true I think its true with  bl  animals and we are certainly enough animals that I think is true with us also  Did Keith or Duncan manifest any program for their life in the way we just talked about I dont remember anything particularly I do remember  because Keith was an adult by this time  telling him something that had occurred that seemed very much out of the ordinary and Keith said Id be good at that He meant in seeing it and feeling it and analyzing it I suppose Duncan on the other hand Duncans first word was no  I would like to hear more about Krishnaji I think this is one person we have talked least about in going over these remarkable men in your life And you knew him for more than twentyfive years between 61 and 86 when he passed on Could you maybe tell me more about your friendship with Krishnaji As I said I was always running into him after that one time that I told you about in Gstaad I mean always running into him in Gstaad I remember swing down the main street one time Id just come back from a long long walk and he was in a car As I came along he stepped out of the car to visit with me and as I say he said he would go to Paris then I went to Paris And I remember in Paris leaving the hall  I think it is called Aviar Hall in a little culdesac  it was a pitchblack night and the streetlights behind I suppose plane trees or something of that sort At any rate I stepped out and Krishnaji stepped forward and said Oh there you are And he put his hands on either side of mine holding them and pressing them And we went down to Italy and as I said I got home for the Thanksgiving Im trying to think the next time I was in Gstaad  of course Vanda would lease Chalet Tannegg which was a magnificent big chalet overlooking the town Got into rouble trying to buy a place in Switzerland   You did or Vanda did Vanda  oh me my goodness I couldnt buy a place in Switzerland Vanda did But you see the Swiss werent selling to anybody in any form theyd clamped down very wisely And Vanda had turned over a very substantial sum to this Swiss to get a house and so forth and he just kept it and forgot the house and there was nothing she could do Her family of course disliked this intensely Vanda was not one to cross all the ts and dot all the is in the law I remember her driving which was so funny She had a Lancia  Ive forgotten which model  but she was small petite and she had all these foam rubber cushions behind her and of course it was a gearshift  She leaned forward to shift the gear and these cushions just came shooting out you know all over and shed sit back farther and farther and farther which somehow seemed to make her more heavyfooted on the accelerator Oh she was very very funny But I remember roaring along that highway and saying Vanda youd better slow down a bit And just within a few moments after that here were these highway patrol cars off to the side one of them apparently had some trouble I dont know a flat tire or something and Vanda said See Theyre not so perfect  You spoke English with her Oh yes oh yes She spoke fluent French and fluent English She had met a very attractive woman Carmela Vibrance from South Africa who had gone to school in Florence with Vanda and I believe it was a school where they taught English spoke English  Back to Krishnaji  Well I told you a bit about Paris   You just said that he told you to go there and that you were reluctant but ended up going there I told you about leaving that night leaving Aviar Hall and he was standing in the shadow of one of the trees when I stepped out The first time I first saw him in Saanen it was the first year that he had spoken there and Ive forgotten how I learned he was going to be there Ive forgotten all about it But I do know that Keith and Duncan were home from school and when I asked them if they minded if I went abroad for few weeks they just took a look at each other and they said no wonderful of them  They have been always very supportive and the night before I left they put on a wonderful dinner for me most special  you know theyre both good cooks As I said I was gone and I didnt get back until Thanksgiving I met Keith near Chicago Beloy and I had dinner in a Hotel Thanksgiving dinner with him This was 1961 and it was the first time that Krishnajihad given a talk in Gstaad Im not even sure how I knew he was going to speak there I knew very little about him I had read a few of his booklets From the talks they printed up these little booklets and that was the sum total of what I knew  But wait a minute this was in 1961 You told me that Senzaki Sensei had read or I dont remember in what way come to know about Krishnaji but Senzaki died in 58 three years earlier Nevertheless he was lecturing you said the monks at Ryutakuji about Krishnaji   Yes Much to my annoyance I had never heard Krishnaji and it just seemed to me that   you know what in the world is Senzaki Sensei doing talking about this man and    and what did he know about him had he met him Yes he had A friend of mine and actually I think it was the friend through whom I came to hear about Krishnaji talking in Saanen Helen Corall an older woman had often wanted me to go up to Ojai with her and listen to his talks There is nothing so stupidly stubborn as ignorance And believe me I was every bit of that I didnt see you know why I should go up and listen to him I mean I had Senzaki Sensei and Zen and    and Soen Ros hi  Yes I suppose by that time I did Im not sure because of course it was a long time before Soen Roshi could come to the United States Anyway yes I was very irritated with Senzaki Sensei for talking to the monks at Ryutakuji about Krishnaji  This means though that in 55 when you and Senzakisan went to Japan you already knew something about Krishnaji Oh I heard about him Id heard the name certainly but I didnt know him Id never heard him talk and Id never read any of his talks never And as I said it was Helen Corall I was very very fond of Helen   So she got you interested in him  Yes She was the one who got me interested Shed bring these little booklets you know and I wouldnt read them  typical  and finally one time she brought one f the little booklets and  she was staying with me that was after we had moved up here up north  when I said What would you like to do she said Would you read aloud to me And I said yes   So thats how she got you Thats how she got me She died bless her on a Christmas day  so I went over that and it was the first of Krishnajis talks in Saanen  Would you say that the death of Senzaki Sensei three years earlier has somehow left a vacuum in you  No no I wouldnt think so I honestly dont know what prompted me it came up very suddenly The talks in Saanen were to begin Id say literally like the day after tomorrow when I heard about them And I asked Keith and Duncan and bless their heart they said Yes you should go I landed there just in time literally for the first talk And I remember when I called the travel agent because I had no idea where Gstaad was not the foggiest and neither had the travel agent He said Where is that And I said All I can tell you its in Switzerland How the times have changed So I went over and this was held in the Landhaus in Saanen upstairs in a room like a small auditorium and it even had a stage and on this stage there was a perfectly plain straightback chair Ruthy got into the hall and sat right on the aisle she looked right up to the stage Well when Krishnaji came in  he was always very prompt  he sat on a chair and he had his hand on either side of the seat and he looked over the audience and looked at each person As I said I was sitting right on the aisle and when he got to me there was an immediate connection that I felt  Whether he did or not I cant say but I certainly did I remember he said Most of you here have been listening to me over the years You say that I always say the same thing I guess I do but thats it And he said Of course there are those here who will really hear what I say in a different dimension I dont think he used the word dimension but it was the equivalent And at that I just felt as though I were ignited After the talks of course he was staying with Vanda who had leased Chalet Tannegg and she had this Lancia  Flaminia Yes Well The car had been parked across the street and Krishnaji was standing by it I guess Vanda was trapped inside because the people who came out of the Landhaus just stood perfectly still like a flock of sheep looking at Krishnaji across the street I waited for a moment or two for the people to move I thought this was utterly ridiculous So I just stepped out in the front and walked down to the station which was about a block away and as I went past I just simply said Good morning Mr Krishnamurti That was that And I remember having lunch up at the little Hotel Saanen Moscher and reviewing what Krishnajihad been saying It was a wonderful time you know It was really wonderful So thats the way that began and then I told you about being out for that walk  Yes when you met Vanda   Yea Vanda and Krishnaji yes K The thing that was surprising I mean he knew  Well it was not really surprising but it surprised me at that time that he knew that I was the one who had asked you know I dont mean I was the only one but  at any rate  And then I told you about luncheon after the interview not the same day two or three days later and I told you about Paris The thing was it seemed to me Gunther that what K was saying was exactly what is in Zen and these various stories about somebody dropping a pen or something of that sort It was all of a sudden this thing that breaks through provided a person is shall I say really listening   Ready    and of course the amazing thing is that when that took place for me  I didnt have to think I was not even aware that I had had to think in the past about you know shall I do this shall I do that you know shall I do the dishes now shall I do them ten minutes from now everything just went along by itself Even driving I was perfectly aware I was believe me very compos mentis no flaking out nothing like that very aware but  different quality to it When I was aware I was absolutely tireless I mean I was so free  And Vanda my goodness what that woman did for me that year She absolutely gave up every bit of her time to me when I was in Italy And she wanted me to stay with her at least so she said because I was staying in this miserable little pensione  Gosh it was so cold Pensione Texas   Oh God Yes You know where it is  No no but thats an amazing name Yes well it was run by these two Texans  I dont think they were One of them was named Danilo that doesnt sound very Texan to me  But Vanda would pick me up feed me a wonderful midday meal because she was a vegetarian of course she was reared a vegetarian  Its quite rare in Italy Well here too but in Italy especially Yea Well I tell you its catching on here Youll even find things on TV you find pizza vegetarian pizza for example  Well its more difficult to find it in Italy  Well any rate  Vanda remembers Krishnaji coming to her familys home I think her family were Theosophists So that was it  Well we are still only in the first year and I hope that there were other highlights in those twentyfive years that you knew Krishnaji But let me sidetrack for a moment Wasnt it in the early sixties that you also decided to get your Masters degree in Asian studies Yes in 62  How did that fit in with what you just told me Was it in any way connected with your experiences in 1961 or was it connected with something else   Why had you decided  I decided to do that because I was divorcing John John was playing his usual games and I just thought that Id better get a teaching certificate Well I eventually got one for California colleges the community colleges You didnt know that you were in such exalted company did you  Nol But I appreciate the fact Good I hope fully Anyway thats why I came back In 1962 I went back to Gstaad And I had actually made arrangements for this before I left Gstaad in 61 because I had stayed in the miserable little hotel right by the railway station with bells that were ringing all night long and not the kind of bells you cared to hear So I went to a home a private home and a man and a woman had this Chalet Lucy which had just been recently built and I made arrangements to have a room there  A bed and breakfast  No nothing was said about that I ate my meals most of them at the Post Hotel Rossli down in Gstaad Of course I usually kept things like yogurt or something in my room Anyway I made these arrangements Their name was Ruesch does that sound possible Any rate fine When I got over to Gstaad I discovered they had both died during the year and the daughter and her husband and a Sennerhund  are they like the San Bernard but only a little bit different Anyway they had an enormous puppy there huge who would make a variable lake at the bottom of the staircase They assured me that everything would be just the same that I could come in and so forth but it wasnt at all because Im sure that the mother and father would never have put up with a puppy and the puddles and some other things that went on But  it was while I was there that I decided Id better get myself my Masters So I came back and found myself a little apartment in Claremont the Claremont colleges over a garage called Colleran and Blitzen And thats where I lived and worked for my Masters  Was that a stimulating experience You knew probably more internally about the religious experience than many of the people who were teaching classes there  Well maybe I did Certainly I had some strange experiences One of my committee was a very strong JudeaChristian person And he knew about Krishnaji and he simply couldnt get it through his head how a person who had been such a strong Zen person could possibly find anything in Krishnaji I dont know what he knew about Krishnaji but that was he I had an examining committee of three I had already been told Gunther much earlier by John Dodge who was Dean of Advanced Humanities at Stanford that anytime that I wanted to work for an advanced degree he would be very happy to okay it And I didnt go there because Sokol was becoming emeritus or would before I finished my Masters and there was no replacement that I knew of Stanford had a nil department of various religions of course now they have changed again but anyway So I chose Claremont because Claremont had a quite of faculty Im sort oflost again   I had asked if you found your time in Claremont stimulating worth your while Oh yes I enjoyed it really I often chuckled at myself because I thought for goodness sake there were people there who had been working for their Masters three years four years and everything and I just couldnt understand it and I thought After all you attend the lectures you write your papers and I have every weekend free I go see my friends roundabout Well I want to tell you I worked every night to midnight weekends included and it wasnt as I thought it was going to be at all But I enjoyed it because I like studying if I like my subject and I liked my subject And I also liked my committee even including this funny person who was such a JudeoChristian No the men in my committee were really very nice very fine men   There were no women at that time No not in my committee And I had fun One time I dont know how it came about but I gave some lectures on Zenga and I illustrated I cant imagine how I got the kakemono down there to illustrate them I dont remember but somehow or other I did So now where are we  Your experience in Claremont Well I mean I liked Claremont very much and it was a little college town in those days I guess now its just nothing but filled up with smog  What did you write your thesis on Or did you not have to write a thesis I didnt have to write a thesis But it would have been on Zen And thats what they used my Buddhism and Zen  Oh I see  They accepted that Its interesting because I saw these people around me who had been there for three years who had been there for four years   And who were half your age Yes and still they didnt have their degree and you know you dont go to school for free either I got to thinking about it and one day I went through the requirements and I wrote down all the requirements and when   lape 6  Do you want to know more about Krishnaji  Yes Well I think Ive already covered it Didnt I say that I realized that what he was really speaking about was the crash that comes in Zen or the accident that comes in Zen and wakes everybody up  Not everybody but  Maybe not everybody but a lot of people So I was in Saanen in 61 and 62 I came back in 62 and went to school again and  I guess thats about that  Somewhere around the time you also did The Iron Flute I forgot when I did that I do know   I can look it up if you want  There is one over there    Yes  I do know that Buddhism and Zen was published by Tuttle and Tuttle was most unfair as a publisher    It says First edition 1964 So it must have been written right after you graduated You went to school in 62 I finished in 63 because I did it in one school year  fortunately because of what happened to Keith He had marvelous guardian angel who saw that I was all ready and free for Keith And what I did   To back up I went through the requirements and found just when these studies would be given and I listed the things up so that I could do this in one year It meant working hard but I could do it And then to nail it down I took it to the head of my committee and had him look it over and he said I dont think you can do this and I said What I want you to do is to put down that if I do it I will get my degree and I want to sign it And he did And its a good thing I did it too  Poor little old Keith  Keith had been accepted for the officers trading course and the date had been given As a matter of fact he was just marking time in Chicago waiting for this and as I said he had this wonderful girl oh Gosh she was marvelous  Duncan once mentioned that Keith went out with  I think the sister of Joan Baez who was his college roommate  Oh yes  that goes way back I think I dont remember whether that was before or after all of this yea Id forgotten all about that for heavens sake Keith always had a girl or two but Becky was the one She was most special  Well we still havent solved the mystery of The Iron Flute If the book came out in 64 you had to work on it in 63 beginning of 64 unless you had done the book a lot earlier and they just kept it in a drawer and didnt publish it until 64 Well I had done a lot of things as youll discover in the little cupboard down here near my desk when I was with Senzaki Sensei lots of them It was very difficult to· get him to work like the Book of Equanimity He just wouldnt work But bit by bit I did get a few things put together and then I kept all of his papers  well I kept one of each he had duplicates of some and I was foolish enough at one time to buy a big file drawer for them go through and file them all I might as well have saved my money and saved my energy He had those all over the house and out of the drawer in no time Any rate Do you smell a skunk  No It must be some little fellow down here every once in a while I get a whiff They dont bother me the way they bother some people I remember when I was a little girl my father was out on a project on a reservoir and my mother and father had this big tent and right across from it I had a big tent and my father had his drafting board And my mother said they were awakened one night with me saying Now you get out of here you just get out of here And my father got up to see what it was and apparently there were two or three little skunks in there   Lets go on maybe with Krishnaji We are in 64 Did you have a correspondence with him No So you just saw him maybe once a year or so either in Switzerland or in Ojai I dont think he was coming to Ojai at that time so it would be only in Switzerland As a matter of fact I got him to come back to the United States to give a talk at one of the Claremont colleges And he finally agreed to do it if it were just for the colleges and didnt get spread about He said he didnt want anybody in Ojai to know that he was there He was having difficulties with Ojai I didnt know what at that time and Im not sure that I even know now And bless Patsy this friend of mine who simply cant keep her mouth shut and who is always kind of showing off  I am very fond of her but  she was told not to say a word she is one of these persons who likes to be the firstest with the mostest At any rate I met a couple around here  I wasnt living here at that time but in the area  and they said they were looking forward to hearing Krishnaji I said What makes you think hes going to be around Well Alan Watts had told them So I traced it down and sure enough it was this friend of mine When she was up here visiting me I said Lou you were not supposed to say one word about that and she said Oh no thats not correct I said That is correct and I said I want you to phone now and call Bill Rample Well Bill Rample lived in Claremont and he was the head of the Blastio  Institute it was he who provided the financial backing for Krishnaji to come to Claremont And I said I want you to talk to Bill Rample I said and Im going to listen in on the other phone Gosh I was mad So anyway she did and he said Oh no   and she said Nothing was said about it at the meeting And he said that it certainly was  But you know Louise was just floating around Louise was a born actress And very quick but in many ways without the information I would expect someone of her caliber to have Her father was a Republican senator United States Senate and Louise was borne in Montclair which is a very expensive suburb in  I think it is New Jersey ismt it Louise went to Vassar I mean far from stupid but at any rate  Her full name was Louise Pedellford and her husband her exhusband is still living and I talk with him periodically He lives down south awfully nice person His father was the Dean of the English Department University of Washington I was very fond of Morgan And as long as you got this all on tape he will never be forgotten He was in Italy when I was there and if I hadnt been so sort of battered from my divorcing John  it took years John was always in contempt of court or off someplace or something and it was dreadful   so battered there is quite a chance that I would have married Morgan Morgan was not the kind to make a pass of that sort but I always knew that he liked me specially And as I said he was in Italy when I was there after divorcing John  72  And how did Krishnajis talk in Claremont go Well he stayed in Claremont for a while He gave several talks I guess he must have And here we go again with Lou She was going to get the house for Krishnaji and the person who was taking care of him to live in  Not Lou No he came right up to the post and she hadnt done one blessed thing And yours truly flew around and found a house and all the things that were necessary  Lou just  she is simply incredible but cute sense of humor wonderful person to travel with because she had a lot of interests I mean maybe just a flash in a pan but they were good while they were there I was very very fond of Lou and Keith and Duncan both were very fond of her She introduced Keith to opera when we lived in Pasadena of course Keith was just a little boy maybe eleven twelve or something like that she took him a time or so to the opera And he is a real buff now always has been since  To go back to Krishnaji were there any more such remarkable experiences in the years that followed As    As the ones that you had at the beginning Yes but they are never the same twice they are always different Yes they are always different I remember one time being in Italy I was on my way down to be near Vanda K was with Vanda I believe  he must have been  and they had gone I didnt realize it at that time but they had gone down to Southern Italy to some resort or something and I was staying at a third class by Italian standards pensione in Forte dei Marmi It was a pretty poor picking but it didnt bother me in the slightest I can remember there was a downpour one night and I remember putting on my shower cap and leaning way out of the window while the rain just drummed down and loving it just being very very happy And a day or so later I had a phone call from Vanda and I couldnt figure out how she had found me Because I didnt know where I was going to be and most of the pensiones there in Forte dei Marmi in that time of the year had closed But between Vanda and Krishnaji they phoned me    Well let me ask you a whole different sort of question It would be mandatory if I were a female interviewer Im not but it might still provide an interesting angle  Now all these teachers from Senzaki on to Brugh Joy were male and you were a woman  Yes all except this Carolyn Congers Ive spoken about Of course I wasnt with her very long  Do you think that this somehow had a role That if you had been a man you might not have received the teachings or the attention or that your relationships would have been different What were the advantages and what the drawbacks of being a woman in your religious pursuit or in your pursuit of your religious interests Goodness Gunther I dont know It has never even occurred to me I dont know I think there is this as one moves around one finds many more women interested in religion than men at least so far as one can tell  Oh thats certainly the case But still most of the teachers are male the followers are female and the teachers are male Right I think the thing you have to do is speak to someone like Brugh Joy and find out how they look at it I honestly dont know  I thought from your experience as a woman in all these relationships with male teachers  As I said I never thought about it It never occurred to me  Do you think the next time around youd rather be a man or a woman Well Ive often thought that I would rather be a man but it had nothing to do with religious teaching And up until the time that I read Brian Weiss I had been led to believe that once you were born a woman you always return as a woman and I thought   Who led you to believe that Oh I dont remember right now and you probably wouldnt know them anyway Gunther but that always seemed to me very unbalanced  Of course Well in some Eastern teachings they say that you can not achieve full enlightenment as a woman that first you have to be reborn as a man and only then you will be able to go the whole way You can get up to a point as a woman but in your final incarnation you have to be male Well maybe I dont know I have no idea  But more enlightened teachers have discarded that and said no it is not the case from the time of Buddha its always been clear that it doesnt make any difference whether you re a man or a woman as far as your potential for reaching Nirvana or full enlightenment is concerned I do know that there are two women in Duncans life in the past who were  I would hesitate to call them  oh they were teachers and I suppose world teachers in the sense that they traveled around a lot and taught in different places No I have felt for myself that in order to have experiences of all of life to be balanced that a person would have to have an experience as a male and as a female I just  I feel thats essential So you said before you often thought youd rather have been a man than a woman  Mm  Mm   I thought they had much more freedom  you know Girls dont do this girls mustnt do that and it reminds me of a story that I was told about my grandmother whom I never knew because she died number of years before I was born The one who came from Poland Right yes She was reared with her cousin a little boy and apparently she went through these things you know Little girls dont do this little girls dont do that So one day she just took scissors and chucked off her hair that made it all right she was going to do what he did I know just how she felt Even nowadays I dont think Ive thought about it for a long time Gunther The only thing is that now crediting Brian Weiss as I do he points out that there are the two And that makes sense to me otherwise there would just be two lopsided     Well what happened in the years between 6667 and the time when I met you in 83 There is a good fifteen sixteen years in there When my degree became final which took years of getting I went to Europe and intended really to find a place over there to live I liked many things about it so much better than here and I felt very comfort  able Then I think it was Keith who was going to be married and wanted Duncan and me there for it Duncan in the meantime had also come over although he had been over earlier as you know there is Stanford in Italy And I came home for Keiths wedding and decided that after all I was a Westerner and Id stay here and work the other way In some ways Im very glad I did In other ways I missed many things I know One of them Gunther is that Americans have this peculiar thing that women and men should be paired off Im very fond of women but occasionally there is a stimulus to have a good conversation with a man who looks at things differently And as I say in Europe it doesnt matter if you are the fifth woman or the seventh woman or the ninth woman at a luncheon or a dinner or a group and here it does So I didnt like that But on the other hand I say there were things here  because I am a native  which I felt would be more comfortable In 1967 I went back to Europe and I picked up in Amsterdam  I flew in KLM  a car which was waiting for me in this case a VW Squareback and I drove all over with it The tancolored one that Duncan later had The blue one Oh the blue one yes He also had a blue one sure I loved that car I drove all over in it I had some interesting experiences in it Are you familiar with the Dutch of course I cant pronounce the name but the 0   It is like a national park theyve kept it with no buildings on it Well there are wild boar in there and of course to a native Californian wild boar At any rate I went in there late one day I had come back up from Switzerland I dont know how far I had been driving that day but any rate I went into this park it was very late and these boar came clustering just around the car and their little hooves clawing at the side Also that time I decided that I would like to do an article on gypsies I read a book in the library it had been written by one Petro Lengro who was himself a gypsy and I learned that there were gypsies and gypsies And that they got their name in English from the fact that they would tell the English people they were from Egypt Someone whose name I dont remember had traced them in language and he could tell oh how long theyd stayed in one country and how long theyd stayed in another and Egypt was never a place where they had really been in And he made a distinction between what is termed Dedecai which means the ones who live like gypsies but who are not gypsies In the case of the Dutch gypsies some of them are as blond as you can imagine So I found out where their camp was and I went to it I left my car a little away took myself a little walk and   On your own Yes I was alone And I had my pockets filled with LifeSavers and I also had my camera but I didnt want to expose it too much I mean I didnt want to lead with my camera so to speak So I went in There was a funny little footbridge no wider than that blue chair over there then I went over a ditch that was filled with scummy water bright green with algae I guess I went over this and immediately came to this circle of vardos thats the word they give to their wagons and it was just as though it was a film I mean the women would come to the door of the vardos and lean against arms crossed watching me There was a group of men by a corner of one of the vardos a little dog started yapping at my heels I just walked and I figured the best thing to do was walk towards the men which I did And when I got there I asked if there was anyone there who spoke English  I guess they all did actually  There was a Mr Boselli  Did you know of him  his name was in one of the books It said that in English Boselli was Boswell Of course theres Johnsons Boswell which I had read So I said Does anybody speak English I guess they all did Anyway Mr Boselli spoke up and I asked him his name and he said his name was Boselli and I said Oh thats Boswell in English isnt it He said yes Well it sort gave a start And then one of the men who had been leaning against the side of the vardo said Ill let you to take my picture for twenty dollars And I said Look if I take your picture I charge thirty They enjoyed that at his expense So we were off to a fine start We had LifeSavers and the next day I was invited in to a couple of the vardos and I took pictures and    And didnt charge them anything No of course not  But how did you get the idea of writing an article on gypsies I dont know  I dont know  Its not quite the alley that you had been pursuing in those years I truly dont know but I do remember that by this time the Netherlands had a freeway system and I was on my way to Germany and this car honking and honking passed me and all these men leaning out of  the windows waving at me It was this group from the gypsy camp Oh it was a lot of fun  So did you write your article What did you find out there Well I found out I guess first of all about the two types the real Romany and the Dedecai And while I was there they brought in with a quite bit of excitement and delight   they had found a house a small onestorey house it might have been a school house I dont know   they brought it into their Romany camp and I have pictures of them doing it And as I said there was lot of excitement about that I dont know what they were going to do sell it to someone or put it up there I dont know But I found them extremely interesting Their life cant be easy Another thing Mr Bosellis vocation much to my surprise was making violins And thats what he did  Did you ever read Robertson Davies One of his novels is called The Rebel Angels and another one was called  oh I forget Is he the Canadian writer  Yes exactly I know that Ive read at least one of his maybe two and I know that I didnt like him Why I cant tell you at this point  The other one is The Lyre of Orpheus In it one of the characters is also a gypsy and they talk about repairing instruments Apparently they had some secrets or special glues they used that made these violins these string instruments sound very very beautiful I dont know that •  So did you ever write that article that you had set out to write I wrote it and I never sent it out and I dont know where it is At that time I did many things Gunther and thats one of the things that I wouldnt do again but Id write these things and put them away in this file drawer a big file drawer and one day I just went through it and indiscriminately tossed everything out  That was bad Yes it was It was stupid  Kafka was about to toss everything out   Certainly a lack of appreciation of what I was doing or could do or whatever you know I dont know what caused that  When was that When did you do that I cant say now I was separated from John by then I can tell you that but oh Gosh when that was  I dont know Gunther It was just a thing that I did I dont know how it came about  Was it before you moved in here Oh Im quite sure Couldnt prove it but Im quite sure that I hadnt moved in here  And all at once You didnt throw them out little by little One day you decided and you threw everything out Yes yes I just decided yes that this was just a bunch of junk and to make room for something else maybe I thought I needed a file drawer for something else I just dont know I dont know Period  So there isnt a whole literary oeuvre waiting over there to be published I dont know maybe posthumously No I dont think so Maybe a few little bits and pieces roundabout here and there but nothing like this other But anyway it would have been great to have published that about the gypsies I dont know what kind of magazines would have carried it but you know there are the markets that would send it out because they know   If you even had the pictures even National Geographic or something like that or the Smithsonian could have been interested In those days I dont know how interested they would have been And of course Ive taken the National Geographic since Hector was a pup but I didnt think that  Im wondering where my pictures are whether in an album  because I took things on slides and very expensively later I had them many of them converted to   Photos Yes And Gosh that cost a lot but it got so that setting up the screen and fiddling around with the projector and everything was a nonsense and I decided that the album would be much more fun which indeed it  was But Ive told you about the difference in photography I mean in printing some are just wonderful others are just nothing    Well to go back to Holland where did you go You went to Germany from Holland I went down through Germany to Gstaad I went to Gstaad  I think Ive told you that this was  what 67  Yes  How long did those teachings in Gstaad usually last Or for how long did you stay there Well Krishnaji got so he was shortening it First time I was there it was a couple of months but he got so he was shortening it Further than that he used to have  it was an invitational a small group to discuss after the end of the talks And I would guess maybe there were about twentyfive people something like that Of course that was held in Chalet Tannegg  You were always part of those groups No I wasnt I didnt even know about them Anyway I was finally invited and I went of course I told you about Krishnaji asking me why Id come to Gstaad  No Well it was during the first interview  I act as though there were many and I dont know that  there was even more than one  but during it he asked Why did you come And I said Do you mean here or are you talking about Gstaad And he said Gstaad I just looked off into space and I said I just had to I didnt have a reason that I could pinpoint  Did you ever take Duncan or Keith with you when you went to Gstaad No It wasnt because I wouldnt have liked to I dont think they were interested I took Duncan once when Krishnaji was talking down in Ojai  oh I dont know where it was Ojai or some place  and that was all  What was his reaction  Well thats why I didnt take him again   K kept giving these teachings in Gstaad throughout his life so in the summer it would be Gstaad and in springtime it would be Ojai Well he didnt come back to Ojai for a long long time I told you about that episode  I mean getting him to come back to California He said he would as long as nobody knew about it I told you   Yes that time in Claremont  Yea I told you Lou just ran around telling everybody And after that he hadnt been to Ojai and California for years  I once went to Ojai in 87 I was staying with my friends in Santa Barbara and they knew the place in Ojai So they took me there and introduced me to an elderly woman a painter who had been a student of Krishnajis for years She was in her nineties Oh that was probably Beatrice Stone  Yes exactly She stayed in that house and with her was an Indian gentleman who was also always part of Rajagopal  Rajagopal yes And I remember my friend telling me something that there had been some kind of falling out between Rajagopal and Krishnaji I dont know it didnt seem relevant so I never stored it in my memory Yes Well I tell you Have you ever heard the name of Mary Zimbalist  I dont think so Mary Zimbalist was the widow of Sam Zimbalist who was in Italy making a film when there was a big fire in California Southern California and they received word that their house had burned Well Mary a very confident person she was the daughter of  what was his name Baker is the only thing that comes to mind it doesnt sound right but any rate  of a very wealthy American And this was one thing Krishnaji always seemed able to light on a woman with wealth and when she went back to Gstaad  and again I remember this very well I was in Chalet Tannegg and she was there  there was a sort of bloom about her expression and I soon learned that she had more or less taken over Krishnaji and was taking care of him From then on until Krishnajis death Mary Zimbalist took care of him by which I  mean she prepared his meals carried his trays and whatever else Certainly drove him from here to there and everywhere That was the way it was For years she was intensely loyal dedicated and   Where does that leave Rajagopal Well during that period of time it was brought up that Rajagopal who took charge of the publication of the talks and various things and as I understand it gave Krishnaji his money although Krishnajihad been given years and years ago what was a substantial sum that came to him every month Any rate Mary Zimbalist then took care of him in every way and built later in Ojai when he wasnt traveling anymore a beautiful house with beautiful Italian tiles floor tiles and copper pipes underneath so that the floors were warm that kind of thing And she is still living there in Ojai she will live in their house until she passes away and than it goes to the Krishnamurti Foundation I dont know whether it connects naturally  I believe it does now  to the little old house he lived in for so many years when he was there a little wooden house He died of cancer did you know that  No  When I learned that it was a little bit shock to me  Now to speak about his teaching method do you think many people got his message No I think it was very difficult for most people Which reminds me one time when I was in Gstaad and Id been to a talk in Saanen and they had this great big tent there and I was going up after a talk and these two women behind me were talking and one said Well of course he says you shouldnt belong to something but youve got to belong to something so I am a Theosophist No I dont think many people got it  Thats too bad if you consider his efforts all the talks that he gave in the course of his life all the books that were published  Oh they got bits and pieces and lets put it this way it wouldnt hurt them  No certainly And I do regret the fact that they now have the Krishnamurti Foundation in America and a Krishnamurti Foundation in England but thats the way it is  So why do you think that not many people got the message Because the message is so difficult to understand I think its very tenuous I may be all wrong Gunther I mean lot of people may have but I dont feel they did and it seemed to me that possibly one thing that got me to the edge where you cannot go further with the brain was my Zen background I remember being in Gstaad and after one of the talks going up by myself some place just sitting and I mean going on and on and on and of course as I say the brain cannot quiet itself its an impossibility a contradiction in terms actually The mind can be quiet and  for me it was the same as the Zen bit  Do you think that the Zen method of helping people to gain that understanding is more effective with the Kaan practice the meditation life at the monastery  As compared to K  Yes I would think so yes Because there is a certain inner movement with that  yes I think so  You have also done several of Brugh Joys workshops I know of two the one in the Mojave Desert and the one on Kauai Talking about the effectiveness of methods I know thats a very limiting approach but since we started this discourse how are the methods used by Brugh Joy in his workshops in terms of facilitating and bringing about something in the participants Of course first of all Brugh Joy says that the way a person meditates is up to each individual He doesnt give any way of meditating no one And Im sure he also feels that a group you know sort of Where two or more are gathered in my name   by geometric progression builds or facilitates the ability of a person And I think there is a lot to that I know he said one time that if one person grasped understood a certain thing that it went eventually certainly into the others so they understood also  That must have been an interesting experience for you after having it gone alone for so long in your life to see what a group can do Hm   hm  And a group can do it too And does it without even thinking about it  There was an interesting lesson there for you  Hm  hm     Where do we go from here Well I want to be chronological for a while going on from 67 and coming back to Gstaad I went north again and shipped my little car out of Amsterdam or Rotterdam After that I didnt go back to Europe again until 1970 and at that time I flew into Portugal and from Portugal on to Barcelona and to Madrid I was going around Spain a bit in trains And Spain seemed to me a part of it at least just absolutely lunar miles and miles and miles and miles of nothing except these strange little churches and odd little villages and at the top would be a storks nest Anyway I went up to Northern Spain to a little tiny place called Santoliana del Mar and stayed there for few days Its very old and the place I stayed in was the former castle belonging to the head of the Province or whoever he was And then I went on from there west to Santiago de Compostela  Oh you did Santiago as you know is the third visiting place in Christendom the first is Jerusalem then theres Rome and then Santiago Santiago of course because St James was supposed to have been there I loved that place Its much more Portuguese than Spanish And this hostelleria that was built by Queen Isabella and King Ferdinand the building is an enormous quadrangle and had these little celllike places in inner quadrangles it might happen to be St John   Which St John St John of the Cross Didnt say didnt make any distinction that I know I just thought of John McCandless It also had wonderful old tiles on the roof I stayed there for a few days The dungeon or what formally was I suppose the hospital had been turned into a dining area and they had these sconces for these huge torches out for illumination A fascinating place And from here I went back down to Madrid and over to Salamanca I couldnt get there any way except by a cab which I took And a part of the road there was not a road it was just two ruts in a field with weeds in between But fascinating old town And what was the mans name who made that place famous  I know there is the Jew of Salamanca  Yes As I say I spent some time there only a day and drove back agam  When you were in Santiago de Compostela did you feel any spiritual power or did you feel that that was a particular place apart from the architecture I often wonder what makes places a destination for a pilgrimage I dont remember anything of that sort Gunther and I dont know Maybe Im not particularly sensitive to those things Although even as I say it I think of exceptions  For example For example a very strange very strange experience I had in Greece In fact I had two of them the first time I was there The first one was when I was with a very small group perhaps six or seven people in a little old beatup VW van and we had gone out to Knossos Wed been down to what is considered the first road in Europe built of course more than a couple of thousand years ago and there was also a place where they had the bull dancing And I had left this small group and started back up toward the van and walking just on this little dirt path under these huge oak trees Without any warning whatsoever suddenly I found myself sobbing I wasnt crying I was sobbing I kept on going and I came to a place that looked like three wells and there for some reason I stopped And when the guide a woman caught up to us she said They look like wells but they are not they are where at the end of a ceremony the vessels used would be thrown and smashed The other place was also in Greece I never had an explanation for it either I had gone with a couple of friends one young Greek woman and a friend of hers from Switzerland who liked Greece so much that she was learning to speak Greek I had driven out to   I want to say Sunion but I dont think the place was Sunion  anyway Ive driven out there and there was a little refreshment a canopy tables These friends said they thought they would have something and I said Im just going to take a walk around and be right back I went down to the edge of the cliff and looked down There was a steep drop down to the sea and as I stepped back I had this very strange physical sensation I stepped back into where I had been and everything was all right again but as I stepped away from it I got this  minor shock And I got to doing this the same way a child does back and forth back and forth  There was something there but I dont know what but it was very strong and I could feel it  And did you often have experiences like that outside of Greece that you recall Well I had one very different but slightly odd in retrospect The first time that I went to Salzburg my hands hurt a great deal for a good bit  of the time I was there It was as they had been crushed Ive often wondered if that had anything to do with the building of the Archbishops Palace or something of that sort I dont know  We would need Dr Weiss to find out more about that  Yes right but there is no doubt of course I suppose a lot of people felt it too but there is no doubt that somewhere along the line I was very much in love with Salzburg as a place  I was very content there  Interesting I was there for three years I lived there  Yes I know  Interesting combination a coincidence  Ill tell you a very strange experience I had in Salzburg It was when I went back The first time I was there I was there for about two weeks and I went down Bad Ischl and so forth Shall I keep on talking  Let me just change the tape   The following year which could it make 1953 I came back to Salzburg with John and Keith and Duncan Keith and Duncan were not tiny boys but they were still little boys John went down to Italy on business and one bright lovely day I said to the boys What about us having a little picnic Great So we went over bought some nice fresh bread and some cheese some fruit and then I drove out of town I went up the Salzach a ways looking for a quieter road found one turned into it followed along  I suppose originally it was a little stream that had been turned into a ditch for running water  and came to a farmhouse that was all boarded up I looked behind it and it looked to me that it was a pretty nice place for a picnic because it would be over near the water Fine I left the car by the farmhouse and we walked through this stubble over to the river which would have been the distance Id say minimum of a long block Well where we finishedup was an embankment that went straight down it was about five six feet high And I sat there the boys peeled down to their shorts and they went down and into the water and played around edge of the water Well I was sitting there we had our lunch and all of a sudden  sss Something passed my ear so closely and I could I mean the air there was a displacement and across this little creek was a sort of sandy embankment well it embedded itself there and it was a real something because the sand all came down in a little avalanche Of course a lot of people in Austria are out hunting you know their little caps and their feathers and their Lederhosen So I thought there was someone who didnt see me I stood up and I looked all around very slowly  not a soul I sat down again and I hadnt been there more than a moment or two than  sssss Right past my head again I stood up again and looked around very slowly I think I waved my arms to attract the attention but any rate nothing nobody Well this went on for a little bit and I thought This is no place I dont like it here So I handed Keith and Duncan down there the rest of their clothes they put them on and they climbed up and I said Now you stay right behind me right in line and I started   They didnt notice anything No they were down you know near the water No they didnt notice that I started back toward the car through the rubble on this little pathway Fortunately I dont think Ive have ever panicked except possibly more recently when I couldnt breathe or something up to that time I was very lucky So I just kept a steady pace back to the car it was a little Ford Taunus and got to the car Next to the farmhouse there was like a little forest of deciduous trees and in it were all these motorcycles and with the motorcycles were these men in leather coats  they all had rifles  and they just stood and looked at me just  And that was it The boys got into the car of course I had to turn the car around and thats what I did I never did tell Keith and Duncan  oh I may have much later about what had happened but I tell you Gunther I can feel it it was a very unpleasant experience they were getting just as close to me but they couldnt have got closer without going into my skull I did speak about it to some friends in Bad Ischl I said Who would be doing something like that And they said that there was a group they labeled them Communists  I dont know whether they were Communists or not  but they said that there was a group who did practice this kind of things you know scare the daylights out of people So any rate that was what I was going to tell you the other incident  But we wouldnt call this a psychic experience the way the other two were No but it was certainly an experience  Yes no doubt about it But did you have other experiences like the two in Greece that are not so easily explained  the chuse was not so obvious as in this instance The only one that occurs to me at the moment was when I first landed in Norway years ago and again I mean it was at Bergen We crossed by ship the Vossvangen Fjord and again involuntary tears just rolled down my cheeks and I have no reason for it I cant give any suggestion its just the way it was And there is no doubt  I believe Ive mentioned this before  I mean some of my  well I started to say memories are not actual memories they are feelings for and they go way way back I mean more a good deal more than two thousand years But they are all in the northern hemisphere everyone of them Egypt which is as far south I guess as I got  Did you ever feel anything particular of this kind for Japan When you went there did you have the impression that you had deja vus  Oh yes very strongly Japan  I have never been to China but I have a very strong feeling for China I dont know whether its really just my own or from my background You see my mother and her brother were there for he spent years in China and he loved China I can remember him telling me  because we saw him very very seldom  years would pass I would say   Its Uncle Major Yes Major of Mischief I dont remember whether his name was George Elliott two ls and two ts or Elliott George but known as Major  I remember him telling me in March of 33  and I date that because he was there when my mother was so ill and passed away that we would be having war with Japan  Oh really Yes That was pretty far back  Yea it was eight years before it started And even so I mean Rosy had to give it few punches and pokes  Were there any particular places in Japan where you had deja vus Im not sure whether Mito Bay was one of them or whether it was because I wanted to do some photography there And did I can still in my minds memory hear the little soba whistle  We never really talked about the internal experiences you had while you were at Ryutakuji Did you have any major breakthroughs or kenshos or satori experiences Because probably this was the first time you could really practice so intensively before here with the household and children and everything your time was probably quite limited the time you could devote to that And there you  Of course it is a little bit difficult to differentiate because when I was there I was with Soen Roshi the whole time  But you said you followed the routine at Ryutakuji At Ryutakuji yes I did indeed And I had my own little room which was just next to the Hondo I remember the first time I went to the Hondo I was so thirsty because of course there was never any water around  and probably just as well that I didnt drink it  but I was  so thirsty and I remember going into the Hondo first thing I did was stub my toe beautifully because I didnt see that the little tatami bed was raised And all the monks were sitting around having tea Well you know they pour you about six or seven drops of gyokuro and I wanted some more Of course you dont get seconds thats just all there is to it So I remember being very thirsty But except during actual Zazen and Dokusan I was with Soen Roshi the whole time Of course he was busy when he was there and so I didnt see him as much when I was there Soen Roshi was testing me constantly I mean I was always very much on and also very uncertainly balanced He just never let up and it wasnt as though he was teaching all the time not at all And I told you about my experience with Asahina Roshi at Engakuji  I was just wondering more specifically the time you spent at the monastery at Ryutakuji if the Sesshin led to any quantum leap in your awareness  It was very hard on me physically in a way I didnt notice it so much in the immediate time till just toward the end Because the monks would get up at three of course all they did was rub a damp towel over their bare pate and me I had to comb my hair brush my teeth  with the unknown water  and I had to get up earlier Well of course we didnt go to bed until  I forgot when the little bell would ring around at nine ninethirty So it was just  practically nothing And I was cold oh I was cold Kind of weather that makes leaves turn nice and red  But was it the Rohatsu Sesshin No that comes actually in wintertime in real winter  Well its the first ten days of December because December 8th is Buddhas Enlightenment Day in Japan So its the week leading up to December 8th that they have Rohatsu Sesshin But in Japan winter doesnt really set in until after Christmas Well as I recall Rohatsu at Ryutakuji was in January or early February But I wasnt there for it  But that could only be if they had used the traditional calendar with the New Year based on the lunar calendar instead of our calendar Oh I dont know  Nowadays its always the first week of December and it can be cold during that time but its still fall in Japan its not winter Winter is JanuaryFebruary not before We got sidetracked now Before we were in Spain in Salamanca Yes well after Salamanca I left Spain and I took the Iberian Airway up to the Netherlands and thats where I picked up Chris This is 1970  There was a jump in there between the 67 and 70 Yea I wasnt in Europe that time from the 67 to 70 67 was the last time   And 67 you were there and you had your Squareback Yes the gypsies and everything yes  And 70 you went to Europe and you picked up Chris Thats right After Spain I was there first  And where did the maiden voyage with Chris take you Well Chris took me to Salzburg and then I went further east and briefly to Vienna very briefly The Lipizzaner thats what they call those horses I couldnt remember the name of them I saw them rehearsing oh that was wonderful I loved that Then back again briefly to Salzburg and then from Salzburg Feldkirch and down to Gstaad Zurich first I went to Zurich somehow or other  And Chris behaved well Oh I loved Chris He got so much attention because people hadnt seen that model before It was the 164 and people hadnt see that model before So wherever I stopped with Chris to do a little errand or something when I came back hed be absolutely two deep with people looking at him And Chris seemed to love it Thats the way we went down to Gstaad Of course Gstaad in those days was not Gstaad as its now at all It was really for the most part known only to the embassy people who would often go there for skiing near Saanen mostly And you know chalets and small hotels I told you the first time I went to the travel agent he didnt know where it was  So you spent a few weeks there Yes K was there And then  lets see what did I next with Chris  I dont know I did anything Id probably went right back on up to  Germany and then over to the Netherlands and shipped Chris home I guess I must had because Chris arrived here  it has always been most awkward on the 23rd of December  It arrived in San Francisco Yes I shipped him out of Rotterdam Oh it just took forever to get him here All the paper work and everything And then of course that meant taxes were due because California decided that so many people were buying cars abroad and shipping them home they were taxing them just as they had been bought here I dont remember when I went back to Europe again I was over there in 76 but I never left the Netherlands I was in a place south of Nijmegen which is the old Roman Novium Margus in a little suburb called Bergendall And I had these Dutch friends who lived in  I guess any rate They would come periodically to spend a weekend with me  they were much older they are all gone now  but Im very fond of them  And what happened between 1970 and 1976 Aside from being over Nijmegen in 76 I dont remember that I went back again during early 70s  So what were you doing during those years Duncan and Keith were out the house you were divorced I sold the house of course and John had long since remarried He lived in San Francisco  Did you do any particular studies or You had stopped writing I did do some studies yes I would go to night school up at the college I remember one course one wonderful course I took in photography Gosh that man was good He had everything very well organized and he taught photography from A to Z He took us on that field trip up to San Francisco one night for photography Bless his heart he has passed away So I took photography I dont remember Gunther anything particularly special at the moment during those years  Did you have any romantic kind of relationship if I may ask Yes you certainly may Yes I did and it was someone Ive known since I was a little girl Off and on  I dont mean being a little girl off and on I mean I had known him off and on One of my earlier memories was throwing a skate at him that hit him right on the chest  A forceful beginning Yea He went to Stanford  he was two years ahead of me  and I remember when I went to Stanford he started telling me you know I could do this and I could do that and not the other things and so forth I just turned on him told him to keep out of my life and I run it the way I wanted it So we had agreed to disagree and disagreed for quite a long time But when he heard that John and I were divorced he came back into my life and I liked him very much He had many very likable qualities But I certainly didnt want to be married to him And this is a good thing too because I tell you I can just see that feathers would have flown a great deal of the time because he was very stubborn and I wasnt about to give in  With him Thats right  No it wouldnt have worked anyway we were different enough in many ways our major interests wouldnt have lined up But you saw each other Oh yes And as far as religionrelated activities during those years I always had them Its interesting getting back to John because people didnt realize it but John was really quite a womanizer and he wasnt completely happy apparently unless he was sure that I knew about it And he married almost immediately  he married a woman he had been going around with a lot  San Francisco social life And one night Duncan phoned me and he said he had been with John and John was very ill Would I come up and see him And I said Of course So I went up to this little hospital room where John was He was indeed ill and his wife Betsy McClure she was at first was so stricken with sadness that she took herself on a world trip arriving back just the night of his death And she didnt even come to the hospital to see him Life is very strange He left her quite a wealthy woman And of course I have Ive done myself And not too grandly but at least I know where my dinner is coming from I made a couple of bad investments primarily in people But thats just the way it is Ive been always very glad that Duncan spent quite a bit of time with John after John had this major stroke in the hospital I was very glad of that because Duncan and John had always squared it off  I mean John didnt awe Duncan in the slightest With Keith it was different Keith was always looking for Johns approval and John would never give it  Talking about Duncan in our Pasadena house we had an upstairs and downstairs and everything was floored in hardwood including the stairs I mean we didnt have them carpeted Duncan had come in one day and apparently he interrupted John when he was reading the paper And John had gotten cross and sent Duncan up to his room Duncan hit every stair up to the landing At the landing he turned and said All right old Mr Bossy And hit every stair for the rest of the way Of course John was furious But Duncan told me that from that time on John was in his life in a very different way out of it for the most part But when John became so ill it was Duncan who really gave him a lot of attention and affection and had him moved from a dull cold room to a sunny room  things of that sort I was very glad of it Good grief    So the first part of the 70s were quiet years   It seems to me that I did go to Europe once during that time but Im not so sure when 74 perhaps 72 maybe    You have been talking about Eido Shimano being a monklet at Ryutakuji and also that you gave a talk Could you please repeat what you said in that talk Well the gist of it was I simply told the monks not to plan to come to the United States unless they were deeply immersed in Zen and only Zen that they were not after money or anything else Because I said we had had so many and we referred to them as Asian rejects because they couldnt get along in their own countries so they came over here where the values were untutored Then I was in New York and I went to hear a talk of Krishnaji and after it was over I just sat there until most the people were gone When I stood up and turned around ready to go up the aisle there was Eido Shimano I had no idea that he was in New York My recollection is that we met for lunch or something the next day He was I believe married by then and I asked him to bring his wife too but he didnt He started the Zen Studies Center I believe was the name of it It was downtown Manhattan Marguerite Wilkie  it was through her that I met Ann Lindbergh  was very interested in Eido Shimano I  mentioned to Margo that she would be much better just staying with K Time went on Eido got in apparently with a very wealthy group of people He was involved in some sort of scandal I dont know about it except a reference is made to it in Nine Headed Dragon River And apparently he never cleared it up I mean he has never admitted to it or done things people felt he should do Consequently people like Margo Wilkie I mean just tell away theyd have nothing more to do with him It must have been a terrible shock to find out how his behav10r was And Robert Aitken told me one time that on the way over Eido got into some sort of  He said he had a very quick temper besides And then of course he gathered money to build this fantastical Daibosatsu in upstate New York  that cost years and years ago over a million dollars And when Eido was turning just relatively recently one year or two ago turning over the running of Daibosatsu to this Caucasian Roshi that he appointed the paper that he sent out on it recommending him said he had chosen him because they laughed at the same jokes Im quoting that is a direct quote I do know that he expected Soen Roshi to come for some sort of ceremony This was before he turned things over to this fellow whatever his name is and Soen Roshi didnt reply and he never showed up  Before we started the recording you said something about the Zen of Eido Shimano You said that Noel had more Zen than he Oh yes she knows more about it than he does its a fact Well I mean look at it  the temper the womanizing  I wouldnt expect a person necessarily to be completely celibate for years and years but the scandals are just not good Of course all that money for that building  and to turn it all to that person because they laughed at the same jokes  One thing occurred to me when you were in Japan at Ryutakuji that was in the early 50s to the mid 50s Duncan by that time was maybe 14 or 15 years old and Ifeith a few years older Two years older  Who did they stay with when you were gone Oh they were at Exeter back east We were talking about past life regressions something completely different Did you have any experience of that kind Do you have any recollection  I have had feelings but knowing nothing about past lives at the time let alone regressions I put it down to something else But I think Ive mentioned you about when I first was in Salzburg and when I first arrived in Norway  arrived in Bergen  just tears involuntarily also at Knossos very very strong I know that as a child I loved the things about the ancient history of Egypt I noticed the same with Duncan when he was a little fellow he was much more interested in the ancient civilizations than he was in more modern ones  Did you ever read the book by Elisabeth Haich called Initiation No I dont think I ever heard of it  She is probably the wife or the companion partner of Selvarajan Yesudian who was one of the better known yoga teachers in Europe He lives in Switzerland and I read several of his books In that book she talks about ancient Egypt and about her recollections of a previous life As I said to you before my experiences go back to a time a few months before I came across the first Zen group and started Zen meditation And since in Zen pursuing past lives or things like that is not really favored  on the contrary its look down upon is some kind of escapist attitude you deal with your present situation and you dont explore things that go outside I just let it fall by the wayside and never really pursued it any further I think once somebody asked me to do a past life regression Since Ive written down on the steps I thought Well Ill just do a guided meditation And thats what I did Then I wasnt able to bring the person back So I freaked out a little bit and I thought Well youd better not experiment with these things Eventually the person came back by herself That must have been quite a sensation  So I just thought that I leave that alone I think Ive mentioned to you that Carolyn Conger said to me one time Actually when we meditate were out in unknown territory and all sorts of things can happen and often do Thats why a person has to be very well  prepared is the word I was going to use   Grounded  right and clear because these things can take place And just because a person is meditating doesnt mean that their any good    In our chronological narration we pretty much covered the 60s came up to the 70s and dropped off somewhere in the middle of the 70s Of course I was in Europe in 70 I got Chris I put a lot of mileage on him   Not that much I saw 80 000 miles Well six of those were before I shipped him home No I havent because I had to stop driving because of this thing of being legally blind I couldnt get a license anymore But I kept Chris  And its good that you did Yes  Hes been enjoying the little trips the little outings that weve been doing An interesting thing is Duncan loves Chris and Keith wont even drive him  Why not Doesnt like him Keiths car has gone for 400000 miles He is fantastic with his•cars  He has a BMW doesnt he Yes But before that he had a  I think it was a Buick a station wagon that had gone some remarkable amount He would still have that except that he loaned it to Heather and Heather totaled it  Heather is the younger Yes    So 70s I was in the Netherlands I think it was in 76 with the intention of going down to Austria to Salzburg It was so hot it seems impossible I didnt go and they had one forest fire after another I mean the German army was called out Dutch army   it was a hot summer I  was there in 76 after that I dont think that I went any place until I believe it was about 81 Friends of mine I was very fond of  we all had been in college together  liked to travel the way I like to travel which in other words is not on any guided tour  but have a car and just go around and stop when you wanted to go when you wanted to and  that was it They spent a lot of time in Europe Well they told me about a cruise on a Dutch ship the Prinsendon they had taken and enjoyed a great deal So the fact that they recommended it  by this time I was kind of finding it a little bit difficult to drive around and do things  so I thought Well maybe thats for me So I signed up on the Prinsendon for a cruise that was  Ive forgotten where it was supposed to take me And bless Patsy the ship burned It was really quite bad because all these elderly people on it you know and these little rubber life boats floating around in the dark way up north I obviously didnt go but HollandAmerican Line being the type of persons they are  or at least were  immediately I had a letter with my cheque back in full and in the letter they said that they would give me my choice of an roundtheworld cruise at half price or a shorter cruise fully paid for Well not knowing whether I liked cruises I chose the shorter one My goodness I mean they gave me a state room that I probably couldnt have afforded by myself I picked this ship up at Fort Lauderdale and went around and through the Caribbean stopping here and there and then through the Canal and then up to San Francisco I really enjoyed it As a matter of fact I met a couple of men on the ship  I still hear from them Oh really Yes they are very much younger than I but we enjoyed each other or at least I enjoyed them Se let me see That was 81 I believe 82 maybe 84  Golly this is awful I dont remember but that doesnt matter too much I guess  I took two backtoback cruises by which I mean for example one went to the East Mediterranean and up to the Black Sea I just stayed right on And the second one went down to Alexandria Cairo I had my state room single very comfortable and the ship was Norwegian and of course in my opinion they know how to run a ship I sat at the Captains table much to my happy surprise So anyway I took another one on the Vistafjord also and this time went up north into the ice barrier inside the Arctic Circle Was it cold  Well I thought so I have some pictures of it in an album I got this cap down around my ears and a muffler matching the cap all around my neck   any rate yes it was cold Magdalena Bay is one of the places where we stopped We went to Finland which I liked very much and Sweden Back down through to of course Oslo But that was the last cruise Each was a month on the ship    When did you meet Brugh Joy When was you first conference First I heard about him in May of 79 I went to stay with a friend of mine who was ill Louise Pedellford and she asked me to read aloud to her She handed me this book and I opened it to her marker which was about in the center and started reading I found myself very very much interested Its a good thing I started in the center because in the beginning he talked about Tarot and various things that would have just turned me off at that time  nothing like ignorance So I read aloud to her and as I said this was May and I called Sky Hi out in the Mojave Desert and talked to the secretary wanted to come up to one of the workshops which are two weeks each She said Well we are waitlisted for next March I said Well put me down Kirk was living then and I was doing what I could for him  Who was Kirk You dont know about Kirk Oh I have to tell you later Any rate I was doing what I could to take care of Kirk here in this building and I had a call one day  this was late August  saying Can you come to the workshop that will be held first of September I didnt hesitate Never thought of Kirk or anything I said Yes Ill be there And I was That was Brugh Joy Now Kirk Where should I begin with him John had a couple of first cousins his uncles children born and brought up in Tulsa Oklahoma One of them Mary separated from her husband and moved out to San Francisco and she became one of my dearest friend Her sister Elisabeth when John and I moved north we leased their home in Hillsboro a magnificent home very simple and very beautiful He had been made naval attache to our Embassy in Japan They were gone  I think the tour was a year  so we went there in their home Kirk was Elisabeths husband the naval attache a graduate of Annapolis He came from an Oklahoma family the youngest of four sons Two of them went to West Point and two went to Annapolis  oo  One night about midnight I had this phone call from Kirk saying that he had just taken Elisabeth to the hospital and would I go with him to see her the next morning Well of course I went  So they were back from Japan  Oh yes they were I dont know how long they had been back but anyway yes they were both back I went with him to the hospital Betty was a beautiful lovely woman She was comatose and my recollection is that she never did regain consciousness  Did she have a stroke I dont know physically what had taken place I was sort of surprised well more than sort of  I was very surprised that Kirk called me because I hardly knew Kirk I knew Betty long before Kirk had met her I knew Kirk of course in a mild social way But for him to call me  I still think its strange    You started talking about Pasadena  Yes years ago in Pasadena we had a very large garden it was two acres Near the house there was what we called the panel an expanse of lawn beautifully edged with what we call the Florentine design I guess I dont know if you want to call it that or not an arch and a rectangle and a sort of an arch at the other end That day I had paid the excessive sum of five dollars for a little black puppy that was supposed to be a Spaniel but I mean one of his greatgrandparents may have touched a Spaniel once but thats as far as it went We were down on the Panel the children and I with this little black puppy cute little rolypoly   and all of a sudden out of nowhere appeared this kitten I dont know to this day how it could possibly have come to where we were because   All by its little self All by its little self It had come so far as it must have come Duncan picked up the puppy in one arm and picked up the kitten in the other and the kitten gave a token hiss at the pup and then Duncan and the pup and the kitten all went down on the grass again and in a few moments the puppy and the kitten were sound asleep just the way a little child does it too I o  So life went on   And the kitten remained  and the kitten certainly did remain One of his favorite pleasures was to be in the house  we had hardwood floors  and the puppy of course growing would get the cats head in his mouth and would just flip it around these hardwood floors playing snapthewhip with it Well they thought that was a great fun they all loved it In due course the pup produced two little puppies and one of the neighbor children wanted one of them One day the dog went up to visit his little puppy and was hit by a car There were no sidewalks over there That poor cat  it was grown by this time  it went around Gunther for days crying and crying and crying crying to find the dog And thats the first time as I say that I began to realize that cats were not the coldhearted creatures that people have often led us to believe They are not at all I mean Noel is an example Cats are very very loyal and surprisingly they are inclined to be one person Not that they stay solely with that person but they are certainly they show a very definite preference But that poor cat     Before we were interrupted for dinner you were talking about Kirk and we have · got to the point where you said that Kirk called you to ask you if you would go up to see Betty in hospital And you were surprised that he would call you because you hadnt been close to him No Id known Betty long before he met her as I said Yes I was surprised Well I told you about Kirk He was the fourth of four boys and there were two Annapolis and two West Point He was just lost with Betty ill she was comatose and that was about six months Thats a long long time And Kirk would phone me frequently and with an increasing frequency to talk and then hed come down I was not living here at the time but close by The upshot of it was that when I moved in here he moved in here also and it got really to be a bit of a nuisance because he would ring my doorbell at six oclock in the morning and be around till I pushed him out the door in the evening He wanted me to marry him but I didnt want to be married Id been married So that was that Then he began to deteriorate mentally Just couldnt keep something in mind   Alzheimers   Yes That was the first time I had ever heard it  I never even had heard the name before  but took Kirk to my doctor and the doctor told me And the doctor was very worried that you know I was taking on or had taken something on that I wouldnt be able to handle and with reason too because  oh Ruthy again I felt very sorry for Kirk He was from Oklahoma and well there was just  nobody to take care of him They wanted to put him into a home And I just didnt think that was right I mean I didnt think that Kirk was far enough gone for that But eventually he did have to be put into a care center It was supposed to be a good one but in my opinion it was a horror  You went to visit him there Oh yes I should say so But I could see him going down down down and I could also see signs that they had not cared for him properly which bothered me but how do you to prove these things And it was a ripoff place Kirk had beautiful clothes very expensive You know like angora sports jackets and such And I had knitted Kirk a sweater long sleeve pullover Well he hadnt been at this place anytime at all before that disappeared That was the first thing to go the knit sweater Then the jacket Well as a matter of fact he had two jackets Shoes He had speciallymade shoes very expensive And they disappeared And when I confronted them they said You know these old people here would carry them around I said Look there isnt one older person in this building except Kirk who could lift one of those shoes That was a fact Because Kirk was a big man he was sixfour That was a ripoff place but after much too long I was able to get him transferred to a really nice center where they really did take good care What an awful way to end a life And how hard on families I mean I was fortunate but you take a family who has that in the family and the cost of the thing And if they dont do it that way then they have to care for them Poor old Kirk you know what he would to do he wanted a Coca Cola so he got the Coca Cola and he put it in a pan put some ice in it and put it on the stove So thats Kirk    Tell me more about your first conference with Brugh Joy  I was in Sky Hi in the Mojave Desert for two weeks That conference was much larger than his later conference And there were all types and kinds of people there it was interesting It seemed to me that Brugh Joy was  I believe Ive mentioned this to you already he was a Westerner native Californian very intelligent an MD doctor as I told you Good sense of humor and that reminds me Im very skeptical of any person or group that mixes earnestness with seriousness too heavily If they cant laugh or find something really funny then Im very skeptical  And end up like the KGB major Well right Brugh seemed to combine so many things I told you Soen Roshi was brilliant and very humorous a rascal at times And very clearsighted Now you have read Joys Way  Yes Well you know how he went to Scotland and got over his pancreatic business But he has recently been very ill with cancer of the pancreas He was operated on I think last August The operation was apparently successful but he himself says I mean the excruciating pain on one part and then he is out of it then in and again out However I heard just recently that he is giving his conferences again he is on schedule so whatever hes done hes done But he where did I come across this  maybe he said it himself that in the preparation for the operation and the postoperative he didnt want to see anybody no family no friends nobody He wanted to work through himself which apparently hes done   I went to Sky Hi on the 1st of September 79 and the cruises came later I went on the first cruise in 81 that was the one the HollandAmerica Line gave me and then after that I went on four cruises two backtoback each on the NorwegianAmerican ship Vistafjord I enjoyed it tremendously I liked it much better than the Rotterdam  the ship of the HollandAmerica Line which is just three inches narrower or shorter than the QE2 its enormous thirteen elevators On the Vistafjord you go to lunch or dinner when you wish to you dont have seatings you sit with whom you wish There is a great deal of more freedom and I enjoy the Norwegians anyway Of course they have other people on the crew besides Norwegians but all the officers are Norwegians So that was later I think I told you that the first cruise I went on on the Vistafjord was in the East Mediterranean up into the Black Sea to Odessa then back down again and over to Alexandria and Cairo The next one was Baltic to Leningrad as it still was and then up to the North Cape I have some photographs that I took on the North Cape at one oclock in the morning I saw Laplanders and reindeer  but no Santa Claus   oh no he was working that time of year I enjoyed my cruises very much Those were the last I took I was going to go on more but than things began to happen to me and I didnt For one who always wanted to go it alone and at her own pace I really enjoyed the cruises And of course youre not forced to go on shore if you dont want to it just happened that I did I think that the short trip that I enjoyed the most was in Turkey and Asia to Kusadasi and way in to where the old Greek temples used to be way in Thats the outline of what I did I moved here in the first week of 77 I met you in 1983  Eightythree Gunther I cant believe its as recent as that And if I didnt have such faith in your memory I wouldnt believe it Amazing  Yes I came to the States in 1981 in the summer of 82 I went to Mexico and then in 1983 Otto came over and we traveled around the Southwest and came to California I remember Otto didnt want to go back he wanted to stay for more trips Did we all go down to Palo Alto to a place whose name I have forgotten and have dinner there  Yes I remember it was grilled on mesquite wood or something like that I wouldnt be a bit surprised    You once told me a story about Keith and Duncan when they were little and how they got you scared  Oh yes I had forgotten that Theyd been playing and Ive forgotten if there was a ditch or what and all of a sudden Keith came in absolutely white and he said Duncan had fallen down this place and was dead Well I rushed out with Keith licketycut and could hear these loud wails so I knew that he wasnt completely dead At any rate I picked Duncan up and was rocking him back and forth poor little Keith still white He said Im sorry Mama I thought he was dead he told me he was  I can never remember being angry with Keith and Duncan never ever I can remember a lot of times when I just simply had to swallow the chuckles that were coming out Of course they did do mischievous things especially Duncan Keith didnt do so much of that Duncan would always get into something or other But they werent deliberately naughty I dont know how to describe it they were just funny  You also told me once how you cured Duncan of his pyromania Oh yes I forgot that one too Yes Duncan was just always lighting fires and we lived in this large rambling wooden house that was old it had been built in 1910 thoroughly dried out in the Pasadena sun and there were eucalyptus trees all around and you know theyre inflammable even if theyre green Duncan was always lighting fires So one day I took a big blue mixing bowl put some water in it got some kitchen matches  they came in these boxes and there are hundreds  IOl  and hundreds and hundreds of these matches in one of these boxes  I took a fresh box that still had the little strip inside to hold the matches down and I went out and I said Now were going to have a game lighting matches You light a match and then you put it into the bowl Then you light another match light it and so on It took a long long time but that was the end of that But that finished it Oh you have to pull tricks on kids For example Keith always enjoyed his food So naturally Duncan was not going to like his And you got to have attention so sure enough when it became time that he was old enough to be at the table he just didnt like this he didnt like that and he didnt like the other thing So what I finally did on that bid they would come at the table and there would be a new vegetable lets say and you know this business of Eat your vegetable or you cant have your dessert So I put a little bit lets say a flower of cauliflower in the middle of a bare plate in front of Duncans place I said Now you can eat that and if you like it the next time we have it you can have more Thats the way we did it and now he is a vegetarian But Duncan was always into something He was sort of a little mischiefmaker There were some people across from us that went up a hill to the top and that was the edge of the Arroyo They were trying to build a sizable house up there and their contractor would set out these stakes for the strings Hed come the next day and they would all be pulled up This happened several times Finally one night we went to friends in the neighborhood and there was a new couple there Oh they said youre Duncans parents I wonder how they knew that so soon Well it was because Duncan was the one pulling up the stakes I dont know how we got around that one But Duncan was a little fighter not Keith I can remember going down to pick out a Christmas tree in the proper season and Keith and Duncan wandered away from me a little bit I can see yet Keith holding Duncans arm and Keiths little face just  he was afraid because these boys who were much bigger than he and Duncan were tormenting them or teasing them And Duncan with his free arm just spinning like a windmill to go after them And we had every kind of animal you can think of except a giraffe and an elephant and they were the next on our list They just adored animals Duncan had a bantam rooster and some little bantam hens We had a hamster who lived indoors and suddenly disappeared We looked under everything and couldnt find him anyplace After about two days we found him We had an oldfashioned house and there was heat only in the living room and the bedroom  gravity style  with these grills and the grill had a square on it of about an inch and a half and the poor little fellow had evidently squeezed through one of those and of course dropped down to the basement Thats where we found him down in the furnace going around Of course he had been without water he had been without food  poor little fellow  when we  pulled him up he drank until he was ready to explode and then he filled his little cheeks and they just hang down and he never never took a nap without his little cheeks being full he was not going to be without food again We had a chameleon We spent about an hour one night looking for the chameleon and finally found it right by Duncan of course it had changed color again We had dogs puppies cats a tortoise They both grew up with a love for animals and a feeling for them I am very glad about that Years ago when Keith was about twelvethirteen he had a friend Peter Caldwell whose parents had a little cabin up on a remote lake in the High Sierras and they asked Keith to go up Keith and Peter were out for a hike one day and they came to a little pool in a stream The stream was drying up and the pool was isolated There were these fish in it and of course it would just have been a matter of time till the pool was thoroughly dry They walked all the way back down got a bucket or two went back up put water in the bucket and the fish and brought them all the way back down and put them into Echo Lake  That was clever of them to think ahead and know that the pool would dry up  They were both pretty intelligent I think Peter became a doctor Last I heard of him he was living in Washington State    You mentioned earlier that you knew Anne Lindbergh How did you meet her Talk about life leading you I was in New York on my way to Europe I think it was 67 A friend of mine had been living abroad and it happened that she had just returned to the United States and we decided wed meet and have dinner so I could hear about her trip and so forth We were way downtown Manhattan in a little restaurant very pleasant she and I had a small table were sitting across from each other and on the other side of the room they had banquettes Morris was talking and I was looking around and finally I said Morris there is a woman straight across from us on that banquette and I would really like to know her Morris looked over and at the same time the woman looked up Morris got up and left the table went over and sat and talked to this woman for a few moments Then she came back and got me The womans name was Margo Wilkie Wilkie was her married name no relation to the Wilkie who ran for President I like her very much and she said I would like to see you again some time I said well my time was pretty full and then I was going to be abroad for a while She said If ever youre around come on in at teatime I have tea every day at about four oclock I was up I think at the Metropoli  tan Museum or wherever it is they have the Rosetta stone and as it was about four oclock I thought I just take advantage of that offer So I went to her address it was very nearby  East 72nd Street  went up and in and there was Anne Lindbergh It turned out that she and Anne had grown up together known each other all their lives gone sailing together as children and so forth Anne said Im just leaving I have to get back to Darien She lived in Connecticut Anyway Margo persuaded her to stay a few more minutes We did not talk about the weather  it was just as though the three of us had known each other for eons of time To cut that story a little bit shorter Anne stayed for an hour and I dont know what time she eventually got back to Darien And then when I would be in Gstaad she would often be there to hear Krishnaji They had  they being she and  she always said my husband she never said Charles  they had a little chalet that was tucked away beyond a farmhouse which kind of shielded and protected it from invasion high up in Vervey Yes she often came and would be in the tent She and I would be together afterwards  She had a Quaker background didnt she I dont remember that Anyway we became very good friends and I as I said there was never moment wasted on the weather or anything of that sort Anne Lindberghs agents were the Wolffs Helen and Felix Wolff From Switzerland I went on to London with the intention of going to New York and talking with the Wolffs I finally smartened up a little bit and decided the best thing to do would be to phone first so I phoned and discovered that Helen Wolff was in London literally almost around the corner from where I was staying We got together and she said that Anne had written her about me When her husband wasnt there Anne would want me to come to the farm and stay overnight with her Stupid me I never did I wish I had But Id already paid for my demiepension at the Grand Park Hotel some people simply dont have the brain that God gave a goose  Did you become friends with Helen Wolff as well I liked her immediately and she told me that Anne had written about me as I already said She wanted me to write and send her some material which I said I would do  Would that have been about Zen No They say hell is paved with good intentions and mine is beautifully paved No I never did but I certainly liked her and we kept up for a while then kind of dwindled away  This remains an interesting enigma for me you had all these wonderful connections with publishers and high places the time had come when you were freed from your husband and from your childrearing duties  One thing that Ive encumbered my life with in this instance  instead of getting to what I wanted to do and it was all set up for me I mean life could not have done more  was Kirk I allowed that to draw my interest and sap my energy Ive done that before    as I said before by the sixties the kids were old enough and on their own you were divorced I suppose you did not have any serious material worries   No   you had time So its interesting that one day you decided to destroy everything you had ever written and then never wrote anything else Its almost like destroying a life  Yes your own Hmhm   But was there a particular crisis that led up to this or did it just come out the blue that you decided you needed the file cabinet so you emptied it and made a nice bonfire with its contents Had there been an inner struggle You knew how many sacrifices had gone into that all the mornings you had gotten up early to write how much of yourself was in that file cabinet  I think the thing was that it didnt seem to have any cohesion because when I would write I would really write just exactly as Barbara Courtney mentions Stream of consciousness thats the way I wrote And remember I said in there   And so did James Joyce  Ive never even read James Joyce    and Virginia Woolf They wrote entire novels that were streamofconsciousness Anyway I didnt  You see I dropped one thing first in favor of John in spite of our premarital firmlyunderstood agreement I thought and then secondly with Kirk Its almost as though I was looking for an excuse  But unlike John Kirk had not asked you to drop it  No he hadnt But in order to take care of him  because he needed constant attention as this awful Alzheimers developed  I had to stop For a person like me at least writing a cohesive type of writing takes so much energy that that was why once I had taken on the job of Kirk I just didnt have the energy for both    I told you didnt I about this classmate of mine who was at one of our class reunions trying to get money for Stanford  No I dont remember Well I tell it again for I dont mind hearing it myself He was as I said trying to get money to be given to Stanford and he said Stanford is a wonderful place a perfect place Its like my wife Its absolutely perfect  but with plenty of room for improvement Oh I love that  But you still have not answered my question whether there had been any crisis leading up to the destruction of all your manuscripts No not that I remember I think what was the matter was that I had written all of that just as I have told Barbara Courtney just for myself It was compulsive I had to write I had to do the physical act of writing and also I had no one  no one  with whom to confide anything about myself at all I was just isolated for years It may seem impossible but believe me its not So I wrote And as I say it just seemed to me too unstructured and partly I suppose too vague although I dont remember that it was particularly You can understand   But you kept it for decades and then one day you decided to throw it all away or burn it or whatever means of destruction you had chosen At the moment I dont remember either I dont even remember exactly where I was living when I did this It just occurred to me and I dont know whether this is valid or not when I was still living in Hillsboro in that little house and trying to get free of John  it took me years you know It was dreadful This attorney I had who had assured me it wouldnt take me more than a year or so  in those days it took a year minimum  turned out to be a nextdoor neighbor of Johns sister and her husband in San Francisco I got out of that after three lost years And of course John wasnt losing any time nothing held him back Everything he had except his shorts  shirts and ties and his utility bills was paid for by his company A Lincoln Convertible every trip he took everything was paid for Nobody paid for me Any rate it was a long thing The next thing I finally got an attorney who was supposed to be good He said Well the teeth have been drawn in this and we cant do anything for a while Fine I was working to get my Masters and I discovered he would lose his facts and the sequence and everything from one letter to the next He just lost track of the situation Here I was down south cramming and every time the case would come up John would go off to Europe he just wouldnt be around Finally we went ahead with it anyway Now four years had passed seven altogether and I remember being in court and the judge turning to me and asking Can you live on suchandsuch an amount a month It was the amount that John had put down Well instead of coming right out and saying No I certainly cant I think I was so tired of laws and courts that I said I think so or something as vague as that Well it was a rough session I still had the little house in Hillsboro but John managed to get more than his fair share of that I went abroad a day or so later I just didnt want to be around I hadnt been seeing my friends either because I just didnt feel like being with people I think things are perhaps a bit different now but at that time  divorce was not frowned on but there is this old American complex that you go in couples Well I could go to lunch which I did with friends of mine but I never saw any men I could certainly live without them but it just was an unnatural time Again no restraints on John and every penny of his life paid for I know that one time John was in a foreign country and Duncan was with him I had noticed that John had gone to this place quite frequently They all said to Duncan You know your father is a very very wealthy man Of course it didnt occur to me at first that Johns company would pay him in this country so it wouldnt show up here They paid him a reasonable sum here but put most of it elsewhere in addition to paying for everything else Thats the way it was kinda rough Kinda rough is a masterpiece of understatement in some ways  Did it stay like that for some time Yes but I did what I could I began traveling I had found a way to travel for several trips abroad very very inexpensively So I did that  And one day you just decided to get rid of all your writings  But as I said at the moment I cant even remember where I was living at that time It may come back      I think you mentioned the other day that it happened in the late sixties  It could well have been Right now I cant seem to tie it to anything And as I said I just thought it was purely for me nobody elses interest  You also mentioned the other day that the urge to write had subsided Dwindled yes  So do you think this urge to write was one way of keeping your sanity in this marriage situation and once you got out of it there was no longer any reason to continue I think this I had always wanted to write from the first time I could hold a pencil and I remember telling my mother when I was around ten or eleven that I wanted to be a missionary and to write I remember the first time  I know it was in sixth grade because I was sitting next to the window and each row was a grade  the teacher assigned a story writing period I wrote I suppose youd say a fable It contained a lot of conversation for the amount I wrote which probably wasnt more than 500 words and all the punctuation marks were in the right place But as I said I wanted to write since I was much younger I still have this story that had been assigned I just wanted to write period When I got to Stanford I took creative writing with Edith Mirrielees who was a wonderful wonderful person I took everything from her I could So I know what Ill do next time I come around Maybe next time Ill write    Talking about the business of writing Ive noticed also in life that there are certain people who do write but once the compulsion is off the drive is gone then they dont so much Thats why I think there are so many first books and never a third one As to me I think I got to the place in life where having taken on Kirk I just seemed to lose the drive to write and I dont know quite what is behind that Certainly when I start to think about all the good pushes I received from various quarters   Where you very selfcritical with your writing I was very critical with myself in all ways I came across a little slip of paper just about a few weeks ago and on it some moment in the ancient past I had written D T Suzuki told me You should praise  yourself more I dont remember him saying anything beyond that That was his statement You should praise yourself more I think I was very selfcritical and as you heard on the Barbara Courtney tape you listened to from the time I entered adolescence my father was extremely critical of me in every way And I got so that in one sense I had a lot of confidence and in another sense Id just fall apart I think Im going to say very definitely that it was my fathers criticism when I was in adolescence that just knocked that and other things along with it But on the other hand Edith Mirrielees thought that I should write She felt that I had promise And you had gotten off to a good start in Hollywood  Oh yes although thats an entirely different thing  but even so yes Also when I was in college there was a professor a Shakespearean professor who was supposed not to like women She told me one time You should take a typewriter and go someplace by yourself and just type which was her way of saying whatever about my writing But I didnt You see I have a lot to come back to   \n"

    "    - I manually rearranged longer name variations to be listed before shorter ones. For example, I ordered them as “Senzaki Senseis, Senzaki-sans, Senzaki Sensei, Senzaki”. This prevents repetitive replacements, such as replacing “Senzaki Senseis” with “Nyogen Senzaki” and then erroneously replacing “Nyogen Senzaki” with “Nyogen Nyogen Senzaki.”\n"

      "This was in Japan Ruth McCandless think about 196465 and Nyogen Senzaki had not been back to Japan since he had left it early in the century to follow Soyen Shaku Nakagawa and D. T. Suzuki to the United States It was a beautiful beautiful day a Japanese day Ruth McCandless would say There was a very gentle shiguritype rain and little diamond raindrops would come down the fetch of the monastery There was also some sort of celebration Ruth McCandless dont know which one possibly of Buddhas birthday Roshi abbots priests of Zen had gathered from all over Japan and were there in their magnificent brocade robes in this gray gentle quiet atmosphere and Ruth McCandless remember watching them file into the main building and after they were in Nyogen Senzaki and Ruth McCandless went in There were a lot of little lacquered tables around on the floor The people there were all seated on the floor Ruth McCandless remember the monks in their black robes hurrying around to serve various guests That was Ruth McCandless introduction to Japan Sōgen Asahina was the roshi at the time and before Ruth McCandless left Japan  in fact just the day before  Ruth McCandless went to have tea with him at Engakuji and something ineffable took place at that time which has always meant a great deal to Ruth McCandless Ruth McCandless dont know what it was Ruth McCandless just know that Ruth McCandless happened to look up  Ruth McCandless was sitting next to him  Ruth McCandless happened to look up just as he turned to look at Ruth McCandless and it was just a flash an instant of an amazing contact The next night when Ruth McCandless was at the Haneda Airport to come home and it was midnight he was there with Soen Nakagawa to see Ruth McCandless off Ruth McCandless was not surprised about Soen Nakagawa for after all Id been at Ryutakuji for five months but Ruth McCandless was a bit surprised about Sōgen Asahina Soen Nakagawa said Why dont you stay Ruth McCandless said Ruth McCandless have a home and a family to go back to So Ruth McCandless couldnt stay This must have been in 55 though because Nyogen Senzaki died in 1958 Youre right Ruth McCandless remember Ruth McCandless was traveling through Southern France with John we were near Florac or some such place and all of a sudden Ruth McCandless knew  and Ruth McCandless hadnt even been thinking about Nyogen Senzaki  Ruth McCandless knew he was gone   After he was gone did you ever have the impression  did you ever feel his presence or did he ever appear in your dreams The reason Im hesitating is that there certainly are people who have and Im trying to remember now because it happened quite a number of times with certain people before and since Ruth McCandless truly dont remember Ruth McCandless do remember one time being very surprised Ruth McCandless was gathering something and Ruth McCandless felt his hand touching Ruth McCandless shoulder Ruth McCandless turned and of course he wasnt there He had passed away    What are your earliest memories Ruth McCandless do remember holding Ruth McCandless mothers hand standing on a street corner when the fire engines went by they were horsedrawn and there was a Dalmatian sitting up between the two firemen in front Ruth McCandless remember that very clearly It couldve happened last week easily but it didnt  Duncan showed Ruth McCandless an article written by Eido Tai Shimano in which he claims that he has the kesa and the robe of Nyogen Senzakisan Ruth McCandless guess Nyogen Senzakisan just passed them around because Ruth McCandless have one right over there in that cedar chest Ruth McCandless showed Duncan Ruth McCandless kesa which of course is the major passalong  mind you only a symbolical one you wouldnt get much rice in it the other is a magnificent brocade robe Ruth McCandless never saw Nyogen Senzakisan in it and Im inclined to think that it belonged to Nyogen Senzakisans father the Tendai priest but Ruth McCandless dont know It is beautiful and very ornate Ruth McCandless know years ago when Ruth McCandless was in Japan there was a gathering of priests from all over Japan to honor Soen Nakagawa It was held at N agahama outside of Kochi Ruth McCandless went there and stayed at a little ryokan A little mud road would go down to the temple Ruth McCandless walked it down each day  it was about a mile  and all these little children were following Ruth McCandless It was like a crocodile right behind Ruth McCandless  all these cute little Japanese children Ruth McCandless had come supplied with lots of Lifesavers and so the second day Ruth McCandless made that walk and they were dancing along behind Ruth McCandless stopped and opened up a package and passed them around The next day all their mothers with these white aprons were out and bowing to Ruth McCandless as Ruth McCandless went along At the ceremony the robes these various priests and roshi wore were simply magnificent Ruth McCandless must also have some pictures that Ruth McCandless took    You said after Nyogen Senzaki came back from Heart Mountain he stayed with you in Pasadena Yes we had moved to Pasadena by that time and he stayed with us in our home for six weeks because a it was very difficult to find housing and b because during the war that strange fellow in the Oval Office had 50000 blacks sent to LA to Southern California and 50000 to Northern California Up to that time we had never had blacks here  Ruth McCandless mean we had them they had come out with people as retainers and so forth and we had nothing against them  they were wonderful  but suddenly the flood And see the Japanese were gone and they just made ramshackles of Little Tokyo Ruth McCandless remember Ruth McCandless went down one day  Ruth McCandless cant remember why but Im sure it was something in connection with Nyogen Senzakisan  and Ruth McCandless would see people stand at the curb and urinate Very different from when the Japanese were here Nyogen Senzakisan had gone to Heart Mountain just about when Duncan was three months old and Keith was still a little fellow Ruth McCandless would often write to him about them what Id be doing with them and so forth He cut out these parts edited them and put them all together and made a little booklet or magazine for young mothers up there  How did you meet Nyogen Nyogen Senzaki When Ruth McCandless was about in Ruth McCandless early twenties Ruth McCandless read Garden of Vision Ruth McCandless loved it Ruth McCandless went down to the Main County Library in Los Angeles in their Religions and Metaphysical Room to get some information on Zen  not a word So Ruth McCandless continued what Ruth McCandless had been doing which was mainly on Ruth McCandless own meditating as Ruth McCandless understood it Eventually Ruth McCandless went to see a library which was owned and had been built by Manly P Manly P. Hall who was an outstanding lecturer and philosopher in Los Angeles He came out one time to his library  people hadnt been using it much at the time and in order to get in Ruth McCandless had to find the custodian who unlocked the door for Ruth McCandless then he opened the glass cases along the wall and Id pull out the book Ruth McCandless wanted So Mr Manly P. Hall came out one day and Ruth McCandless was seated at the big table reading one of D. T. Suzukis books Zen First Essays Series he sat down and we began to talk and he said that he thought that Zen would one day be very prominent in America It is an American kind of approach to life he said And bless his heart he said You may take that book home if you like to read it And so Ruth McCandless did Then he also told Ruth McCandless There is a man who lives in Los Angeles Ruth McCandless dont think he said monk and you can go down and talk with him Ruth McCandless thought about this for a long time because Ruth McCandless was very deeply serious about it and Ruth McCandless knew that once Ruth McCandless got started Ruth McCandless would not be turning back It was about a year before one beautiful January day Ruth McCandless  walked from our home down to the train that would take Ruth McCandless into Los Angeles  it was three miles  a beautiful walk beautiful day Ruth McCandless got down to Little Tokyo and inquired at a bookstore where Ruth McCandless could find Nyogen Senzaki They directed Ruth McCandless to Turner Street and Ruth McCandless found there this rather grimy little Victorian house Across the front of it was a wistaria bush in full bloom Ruth McCandless went up and knocked at the door  no answer Eventually Ruth McCandless went down and around and up another set of steps knocked at the door and Hai Ruth McCandless opened the door and inside was Nyogen Senzaki sitting at a big kitchen table absolutely stacked with piles of books and these great big Christmas orhaments hanging from the ceiling by strings at different lengths When Ruth McCandless asked him what they were for he answered Oh it keeps the flies away They see this big thing and they go away Maybe they did Ruth McCandless told him that Ruth McCandless was interested in Zen and he just shuffled through some papers pulled out a few and handed them to Ruth McCandless saying You may have these Then he said Come on in well meditate He went into this tiny room Ruth McCandless guess it was a living room put on his black robe over his civilian clothes and sat in front of his table  Ruth McCandless hesitate to call it an altar  which had on it a picture Ruth McCandless learned later was of Soyen Shaku Nakagawa an incense stand a little bell with a fat cushion under it and that was about all We meditated for a few moments then Ruth McCandless left and went home with these papers That night we had an earthquake and Ruth McCandless thought this is really shaking things up    How did you learn to meditate Maybe Ruth McCandless had found a reference in one of Manly P Manly P. Halls books or one of his lectures but there certainly werent any directions No Ruth McCandless just worked out Ruth McCandless own system which was essentially quieting the brain but that was something Ruth McCandless had already done as a child Ruth McCandless remember very well lying in a haystack one time when Ruth McCandless was probably ten years old Ruth McCandless think lots of children do it naturally As a matter of fact have you ever heard anything of William Brugh Joy  Yes Ruth McCandless read William Brugh Joys Way He says in there it doesnt matter which way you meditate you do it your own way  Earlier we talked about Nyogen Senzakisans return from Heart Mountain How was he when he came back how had the experience in the camp affected him  Well if it affected him in any way it wasnt visible to Ruth McCandless He looked the same he seemed the same He was uncomfortable being in our home when John would come home John was just furious that Ruth McCandless had invited Nyogen Senzaki He said Well dont let him do anything with Keith and Duncan Ruth McCandless said Dont worry he wont So Nyogen Senzaki was very uncomfortable It was very difficult to find a place for him The first place was pretty miserable it was downtown in Little Tokyo but anyway it gave him a room but no other facility Ruth McCandless can remember Of course he never did have a kitchen he always went out for his meals Ruth McCandless dont know how long he lived there Ruth McCandless went down to be with him on Ruth McCandless birthday  We went out to have lunch together and as we were waiting at a signal to cross the street this man came up and offered Nyogen Senzakisan an apartment It was a very nice one it was at the top of the little hotel had an elevator It faced south Of course he had books stacked up in every direction although it was a larger place that he ever had before Ruth McCandless dont recall how long he was there but quite a little while and then Mrs Tanahashi a wonderful woman who had been at Heart Mountain and who was very fond of Nyogen Senzaki found a lovely duplex for him on East 1st Street right across from the house that she and her family were renting Mrs Tanahashi had a store in downtown for mochigashi and thats where Ruth McCandless acquired a taste for Japanese sweets This duplex was a wonderful place for him it was so light and airy and he had a big kitchen and a nice bath It was great While he was there we moved north    Could we talk some more about Nyogen Nyogen Senzaki as a person His early early past he was uncertain about As a matter of fact he didnt know when his birthday was so he just chose Buddhas birthday for himself When Ruth McCandless first met him and continuing on  just about all the time Ruth McCandless ever saw him  he was carrying himself very erect he was rather a large man He didnt look Japanese Id say he looked Chinese and he had the long Oriental fingers Ruth McCandless can see myself so many times walking down the street with him in Little Tokyo and hed see somebody and his hand would go up like that it was never a wave never a handclasp it was just this He had been left here by Soyen Shaku Nakagawa D. T. Suzuki had also come with Soyen Shaku Nakagawa and gone on with him but the older roshi from Engakuji had told Nyogen Senzaki to stay here and not to mention the B of Buddhism until he had been here many years And he didnt  When Ruth McCandless took him to Japan Ruth McCandless was struck  and Ruth McCandless dont know whether it was because he was deeply emotional about returning to Japan after half a century or if it was his nature but as we came off the plane at Haneda there were a lot of people who had come to meet him who had made a great effort to get there twice as a matter of fact because when Ruth McCandless had sent the date Ruth McCandless had done it according to our calendar completely forgetting we were crossing the dateline But he paid no attention to them he just walked right past them he didnt stop to greet everybody  nothing We had been put up at a very lovely old Japanese house Fukudaya it was most special We stayed there for two or three days  Soen Nakagawa was with us  then Soen Nakagawa Nyogen Senzaki and some funny little hangeron went north to Matsushima where Nyogen Senzaki became very ill Ruth McCandless think a lot of it was probably brought on by age because he was certainly not a young man but he insisted on eating oysters out of the Bay and that was probably what triggered it He was ill all the rest of the time in Japan until just the very last and he stayed with some people in Tokyo who were koto players How did you stay in touch with him after you moved north Ruth McCandless didnt see much of him after moving to Northern California but Ruth McCandless wrote to him as Ruth McCandless had done when he was at Heart Mountain Whenever Ruth McCandless was down which Ruth McCandless was not too frequently Ruth McCandless would go and see him A young woman came along  she was very fond of him  Ruth McCandless cant remember her name maybe her last name was Orff she became a Zen nun and went to Southeast Asia to one of the convents out there Ruth McCandless know that Soen Nakagawa visited her one time but she died very soon after she went out there she was out there maybe two or three years before she died She wasnt Japanese Oh no she was American very Caucasian Nyogen Senzaki said that he had a new Ruth McCandless or something of that sort Did the physical distance mean that you were less involved with Zen when you came up here or where you just more on your own As far as Ruth McCandless was concerned Ruth McCandless was totally on Ruth McCandless own Ruth McCandless had been most of Ruth McCandless life anyway Ruth McCandless became very much interested in Jiddu Krishnamurtis talks It seemed to Ruth McCandless that what he talked about was what Ruth McCandless understood as the essence of Zen Again there was no meditation you were just on your own Had there been any kind of disillusionment with Zen  There had been a disillusionment with Nyogen Senzaki when Ruth McCandless was in Japan D. T. Suzuki had been given an honorary medal or an honorarium of some reasonable substance for his work by the Imperial Government while we were in Japan One evening with Soen Nakagawa Nyogen Senzaki and two or three people in the house where we were staying all of a sudden Nyogen Senzaki said to Ruth McCandless that Ruth McCandless was there to get an honorarium too Well it had never even entered Ruth McCandless mind But he was very insistent and very unpleasant and Ruth McCandless thought of the times when Ruth McCandless had taken care of him when he was really ill  John wouldve flipped had he known  and Ruth McCandless was hurt and felt badly about it Curiously enough just at that time maybe even the next day we had been invited to a luncheon with a number of roshi and other Japanese and there was a man at the head of the table whose name Ruth McCandless believe was Sohaku Ogata who had come to the United States to be an assistant to Nyogen Senzaki He said that Nyogen Senzaki had a very strange idea about money and anybody he thought had money This filled in exactly with what had happened to Ruth McCandless  On what basis could Nyogen Senzaki make such a statement Good question Ruth McCandless dont know Ruth McCandless think Soen Nakagawa Nyogen Senzaki and Ruth McCandless had been kind of planning what was going to be done next You see Nyogen Senzaki had stayed behind he had to he was ill Ruth McCandless had gone on to Ryutakuji and other places with Soen Nakagawa From the background of Nyogen Senzaki Ruth McCandless learned later on Ruth McCandless think hed had trouble with people in various places Ruth McCandless think thats why he was brought to the United States because he was having trouble with people in Japan  In his biographical sketch Robert Zentatsu Richard Baker Aitken thinks that the trouble stemmed from Nyogen Senzaki outspoken criticism of the RussoJapanese war in 1905 That maybe exactly it But Ruth McCandless think in general he had trouble with people Ruth McCandless had a friend for example who was very comfortably off lived in Pasadena and was anxious for whatever reason to get into Zen He just really treated her badly He was very interested in money but then hed make a remark about how stingy she was But there in Japan Soen Nakagawa eventually talked to him and as Ruth McCandless was sitting on one of these little decks one day he came out and said Ruth McCandlesssan Ruth McCandless guess it has been difficult Ruth McCandless said It has been very difficult and very disillusioning So Ruth McCandless would see him when Id go south but there was no longer that strong feeling Id had  In the meantime though you had developed a strong connection with Soen Nakagawa  Oh yes and that lasted until the very end because every time Soen Nakagawa would come to the United States he would phone Ruth McCandless from Los Angeles and ifhe was coming up this way he would stay with Ruth McCandless  The friendship to Soen Nakagawa overlapped that with Jiddu Krishnamurti So did the disillusionment with Nyogen Senzaki also lead to a disillusionment with Zen in general The interesting thing is that Helen Corral a former actress and a friend of Ruth McCandless always wanted Ruth McCandless to go and hear Krishnaji and Ruth McCandless wouldnt go She took Nyogen Senzaki one time and when Nyogen Senzaki was in Japan he talked to the monks of Ryutakuji one time and it was all about Krishnaji Later on Ruth McCandless did go with Helen Corral to hear Krishnaji and Ruth McCandless found him most special Ruth McCandless found what he said at least most special That went on for quite a while When Jiddu Krishnamurti came back to the United States to stay he settled in Ojai and Ruth McCandless used to go down there when hed give his talks in the Oak Grove As Ruth McCandless see it it wasnt a matter of transferring so much as finding something that was sort of mildly renewing because Ruth McCandless was alone the whole time both in Zen and then with Krishnaji meaning Ruth McCandless had no one to share it with  Did you follow a certain practice during all those years You mentioned once that you got up every morning a few hours before the rest of the family And we were an early rising family There were two things Ruth McCandless used to have to write Ruth McCandless absolutely physically had to write So what Ruth McCandless would do in the early morning hours for there was no other time during the day in that period of Ruth McCandless life Ruth McCandless would just start out with nothing of nothing and let it flow from there to see what happened in a sort of stream of consciousness It was primarily for Ruth McCandless because Ruth McCandless did have to write and as Ruth McCandless would write Ruth McCandless would find certain things floating up to the surface that were good so it was therapeutic  Was it journal writing or did you write fiction It was neither although one could say it was partly fictional But Ruth McCandless would just let it take its own course It was not journal writing although Ruth McCandless had done that years and years before  What happened to these writings Ruth McCandless wrote about a file drawer full of stuff and later Ruth McCandless burned most of it Ruth McCandless may have a few pieces here now but Ruth McCandless doubt it because Ruth McCandless got to the point where far from having to write and wanting to write Ruth McCandless couldnt write And that surprised Ruth McCandless because it just never occurred to Ruth McCandless that  something of that character could disappear It had been very strong ever since Ruth McCandless first learned to hold a pencil  When did it disappear Im guessing Id say late sixties  Duncan and Keith were already grown up Oh yes  To go back to Krishnaji how did you actually meet him This is curious Ruth McCandless was at home and Keith and Duncan were home for summer vacation and Ruth McCandless dont remember how but Ruth McCandless heard that Krishnaji was going to give some talks in Gstaad Ruth McCandless called the travel agency to find out were Gstaad was and the travel agency didnt know That shows you how far back that goes  Anyway two days later Ruth McCandless was on Ruth McCandless way to Gstaad Keith and Duncan had been wonderful Ruth McCandless asked them how they would feel about it if Ruth McCandless went and was gone for about six weeks They looked at each other and it was okay So Ruth McCandless got over there and that time the talks were held at the Landhaus in Saanen Ruth McCandless remember Ruth McCandless sat on the aisle pretty much in a direct line with Krishnaji about halfway back and Ruth McCandless had the feeling the moment he sat down and started looking around there was this connection between us  it was very strong A day or so later Ruth McCandless asked if Ruth McCandless could have an interview with Krishnaji Ruth McCandless was asked if it was important and Ruth McCandless said Yes it is A day or so later Ruth McCandless went out to take myself for a walk  it had been raining ever since Ruth McCandless arrived in Gstaad but just then the rain momentarily let up Ruth McCandless went along the river and of course the weeds were twelve inches high and sopping wet Ruth McCandless walked thinking Ruth McCandless own thoughts  whatever they were  and suddenly Ruth McCandless looked up and there was Krishnaji in front of Ruth McCandless with a woman whom he introduced as Vanda Scaravelli He said to Ruth McCandless Ruth McCandless got your request and Ill see you The next day Ruth McCandless was at Grassmanns a very fancy and very expensive supplier of whatever food one needs for the household and Vanda was there She said Come to lunch tomorrow They lived at Chalet Tannegg which was quite high up above Gstaad Ruth McCandless went expecting other people to be there too but there were none There was Krishnaji Vanda Vanda Scaravelli son Alberto and Ruth McCandless From there on it seemed that wherever Ruth McCandless went the moment Ruth McCandless stepped out of Ruth McCandless room Ruth McCandless ran into Krishnaji Hed be in a car and hed get out of the car and stop Ruth McCandless as Ruth McCandless went along It seemed to Ruth McCandless that what he talked about was the essence of Zen as Ruth McCandless understood Zen you cant quiet the  brain it is impossible the brain wont quiet But getting to that point where the brain has to be quiet by itself because in essence it simply doesnt know the answer that meant a lot to Ruth McCandless That was it  Did you ever discuss that with Soen Nakagawa Ruth McCandless dont think Ruth McCandless ever said anything to him but he understood As you know Gunther there comes a point when a person is simply clear enough that he effortlessly knows not only what he is thinking or feeling but what other people are thinking or feeling too Its no gimmick its just one of the steps that comes So what Im saying is he knew Im sure Ruth McCandless feel sure too that he talked to Nyogen Senzaki when we were in Japan Ruth McCandless dont know what he said but Ruth McCandless think it included the fact that Ruth McCandless had taken very good care of Nyogen Senzaki really not at risk but against Ruth McCandless own family feelings because John was very antagonistic about him Before we were married Ruth McCandless told John there were two things Ruth McCandless wanted to do go on with Ruth McCandless writings  at that time Ruth McCandless was working at 20 th Century Fox  and Ruth McCandless said Ruth McCandless wanted to go on with religion Of course the writing was knocked out right away  Ruth McCandless fault because Ruth McCandless acquiesced but of course Ruth McCandless was threatened if Ruth McCandless didnt do such and such  But Ruth McCandless never let anything touch what Ruth McCandless would call Ruth McCandless religion Ruth McCandless didnt talk about it Ruth McCandless didnt read books during times when Ruth McCandless would bother the person but thats the way it was  Were Keith and Duncan more on your or on their fathers side Ruth McCandless never discussed it with them They were little boys and occasionally they would come up and find Ruth McCandless meditating Ruth McCandless just stopped immediately but stayed where Ruth McCandless was we talked together and so forth It is interesting to Ruth McCandless now that they both have  or Ruth McCandless should say they each have  a very strong tendency toward religion Each in his own way Keith is much more the conventional and has taken a major step  he didnt tell Ruth McCandless he was going to do it he just went ahead and did it and told Ruth McCandless afterwards about a year ago and Duncan in his way has done it also  it is not as formal perhaps as Keiths is but anyway  To go back to Ruth McCandless initial question did your involvement with Krishnaji affect your relationship with Soen Nakagawa No Ruth McCandless dont think so Not from Ruth McCandless point of view As Ruth McCandless said every time Soen Nakagawa came to this country he phoned to Ruth McCandless and if he was coming up hed stay with Ruth McCandless So Ruth McCandless dont think it did it at all Ruth McCandless feel Gunther as the years have gone by Im less and less constricted or conforming    You told Ruth McCandless more than once how Buddhism and Zen came about but we never once talked about The Iron Flute What made you write The Iron Flute The first part of The Iron Flute Ruth McCandless didnt do Paul Reps had done that with Nyogen Senzaki Ruth McCandless think it was Tuttle who said that he had heard and who then published it As to Buddhism and Zen that came about because Nyogen Senzaki had been sent  or told it was available to him  the whole Tripitaka the Delge Edition which is all on little wooden blocks beautifully brocaded books that open up Ruth McCandless was down on East 1st one day after he had moved to that wonderful place that Shubinsan had gotten for him and he said that he was to be sent the entire Tripitaka and asked Ruth McCandless what to do with it Ruth McCandless replied Thats easy why dont you send it to Yale There is nothing much outside of Asia that would have the Tripitaka the British Museum has a few volumes and Yale and thats about all He asked why Ruth McCandless didnt think of Stanford Ruth McCandless said Ruth McCandless didnt think Stanford would be interested It happened just as it so often does that that very night as Ruth McCandless was looking at the little Pasadena evening paper that right on the front page there was a little squib about a Dr Frederick Spiegelberg of Stanford who was going to Asia  The next time Ruth McCandless came up to San Francisco area Ruth McCandless went to Dr Anthony Sokol who was the head of the Asian Studies Department at Stanford and Ruth McCandless asked him what they would think about having the whole Tripitaka Oh he was beside himself with delight and then he wanted to know how Ruth McCandless came to know about such a thing Ruth McCandless told him about Ruth McCandless involvement with Zen and he was just as excited about that Ruth McCandless could see him sit at the edge of his chair When the Tripitaka was delivered to Stanford Nyogen Senzaki and Ruth McCandless went into Wallace Stegner office Ruth McCandless think he was the president of Stanford at the time  and there was the head of the Library Association at Stanford Dr Beatrice Wood and Dr John Dodds the Dean of Graduate Humanities we were all in Dr Wallace Stegners office the red carpet was rolled out nicely and all of a sudden there was one of these silences and Ruth McCandless made the biggest turmoiled blast out of Ruth McCandless hungry tummy It just reverberated off the walls A moment or two later Dr Beatrice Wood said Ruth McCandless think its time we all went to lunch So we all went to lunch The last Ruth McCandless heard of all these books was that for a while they were put in some special library at Stanford Later they were all sent over to Berkeley where they were being studied by scholars This Ruth McCandless must confess rather annoyed Ruth McCandless But if they are studied Ruth McCandless guess thats good  And where are they now Good question Ruth McCandless havent the foggiest  But writing these books on Zen did not make you part of any community of scholars or people who practiced Zen No Ruth McCandless never got any medals if thats what you mean Or do you mean people like Gary Snyder No they were later And no Ruth McCandless was never part of it  And having written these books didnt mean that people contacted you or that you were invited to talk about Zen No Ruth McCandless did get a little notice one day from a French woman at the United Nations who wanted to translate Ruth McCandless books into French Ruth McCandless said Certainly and she did The others Gary Snyder and Jack Kerouac came much later Later with respect to Ruth McCandless beginnings If Ruth McCandless consider how quiet Ruth McCandless had to be and how they splashed around and jumped around and there was a whole group of them that thought that any inane statement was a Zen statement Now thats past too but now everyone in the United States and Ruth McCandless guess in Europe too knows the word Zen Thats something Ruth McCandless had never imagined when Ruth McCandless started out because it was such a remote unknown thing    We developed kind of a red thread talking about the various people that were important in your life Nyogen Senzaki Soen Nakagawa Krishnaji You also mentioned your disillusionment with Nyogen Senzaki Was there any such thing with Soen Nakagawa or with Krishnaji No Only in a very humorous way Ruth McCandless suppose somehow because of Ruth McCandless own maturity Nyogen Senzaki did have a great fondness for money and a peculiar attitude about people who had it Ruth McCandless never saw anything like this with Soen Nakagawa at all and there was no disillusionment but the only thing Ruth McCandless was a wee bit surprised  but it certainly didnt spoil it for Ruth McCandless  was that he was very ceremonial But Ruth McCandless loved his humor He had such a quick spontaneous humor very intelligent and he had a quality about him that seemed to endear him to people and to animals  Ruth McCandless remember in Pasadena one day driving him up to a house  as a matter of fact we were going to pick up Helen Corral  and there was a big dog Helen Corral had often warned Ruth McCandless about the dog she said it was an attack dog Ruth McCandless drove up stopped the car and before Ruth McCandless could turn off the ignition Soen Nakagawa was out of the car through the little white gate and here was this dog this enormous dog rushing out Ruth McCandless can see Soen Nakagawa saying Yes very furious dog very furious dog and the dog wagging his tail But Ruth McCandless also remember being on the train with him in Japan and people would just congregate they just would be drawn to him And he always seemed to have time for everybody to say something As for Krishnaji Krishnaji was very fond of beautiful British clothes handmade shoes and that type of things  he kept them polished so that you would scarcely see anything else That surprised Ruth McCandless a lot but actually as Ruth McCandless said earlier everybody every biped in the world who has been and possibly who will be has something of that sort Its just part of being human In Ruth McCandless Protestant days Ruth McCandless was just very narrow about it in Ruth McCandless feelings Thank heavens Ruth McCandless got over it in time to wake up and see the sun rise  The last person in this string of remarkable men you told Ruth McCandless about was William Brugh Joy Yes Ruth McCandless first came across that name in May of 79 when Ruth McCandless went to see a friend by the name of Louise Pedellford who lived down south in Claremont and who was ill at the time One of the things Louise and Ruth McCandless used to like to do was to read aloud to each other Louise said she had a book it was marked and would Ruth McCandless please read it to her It was marked just about halfway through So Ruth McCandless started reading and immediately found a strong resonance So Ruth McCandless asked if Ruth McCandless could borrow it that night when she went to sleep Ruth McCandless know very well that had Ruth McCandless just picked up that book Ruth McCandless would not have read it    The book was William Brugh Joys Way by William Brugh Joy Ruth McCandless would not have read it It starts out on Tarot which Ruth McCandless dont care for at all he did mention the Ching which Ruth McCandless have had and enjoyed occasionally quite a while But Ill tell you now that Ruth McCandless dont feel the same about Tarot Ruth McCandless wouldnt get myself involved and go on and on and on about it but in its place its okay It seemed to Ruth McCandless  Ruth McCandless gathered it from the book and it was substantiated when Ruth McCandless saw him  that William Brugh Joy embodied all the things that Ruth McCandless had found in Krishnaji and Soen Nakagawa only he was a native Californian very good scholastic background so much so that his interest and backing of certain things really made Ruth McCandless take another look at them Then Ruth McCandless decided Ruth McCandless better go to one of these workshops and see what he was like Ruth McCandless phoned up and the earliest they could get Ruth McCandless in was  on a waiting list  for the following ·March Ruth McCandless asked them to put Ruth McCandless down and they did Then one day in late August Ruth McCandless got a phone call and they told Ruth McCandless they had a place at the end of August and they asked if Ruth McCandless could come Ruth McCandless said yes Ruth McCandless didnt look at a calendar Ruth McCandless just simply said yes Ruth McCandless drove down to Sky Hi in the Mojave Desert There were 38 or 40 of us it was a big sess10n Ruth McCandless liked William Brugh Joy very much He was young at the time  in fact hes just six month older than Keith  and had graduated with honors from USC and USC Medical School as you know from the book probably Thats been interesting with him and Soen Nakagawa Soen Nakagawa is brilliant really and has a marvelous sense of humor Did Ruth McCandless mention to you a man by the name of Oliver Manly P. Hall He was in that first session Ruth McCandless was in a youngish man maybe your age We were seated on the floor in this room and William Brugh Joy was thinking of something and finally he asked what day of the week it was This Oliver Manly P. Hall spoke up and said Do you mean to tell us that here you are guiding all these people and you dont even know what day of the week it is  If  And Duncan tells Ruth McCandless that this new place he has in Arizona is just beautiful  You also went to Hawaii for a workshop didnt you Yes that was about six years ago Ruth McCandless went with Ruth McCandless big floppy straw hat summer clothes denim skirt  and it poured the whole time We had a house right on the beach William Brugh Joy has lightened up his groups a lot  at least the ones Ruth McCandless know about  now its usually not more than twelve people  What were the insights you derived from these workshops what did you learn Ruth McCandless dont know that Ruth McCandless can put it down that way You know Ruth McCandless spent Ruth McCandless life alone most of the time So these workshops gave Ruth McCandless some support and confirmation at times and Ruth McCandless just feel that although Ruth McCandless dont know how much of it contributed to Ruth McCandless general growth without it Ruth McCandless would be perhaps a little bit different So Ruth McCandless feel it has contributed to Ruth McCandless growth But thats nothing Ruth McCandless could substantiate of course  This takes us into the realm of beliefs and ideas you have developed in the course of about sixty years from reading Garden of Vision up until today Ruth McCandless would say this very definitely There was a time when people would talk about praying to God And it bothered Ruth McCandless because Ruth McCandless dont happen to believe in an anthropomorphic God Ruth McCandless feel to have held that belief has held back Western civilization a great deal But Ive come to the point where Ruth McCandless feel very definitely that anybody anywhere  downtown San Mateo or faraway Polynesia  the person is praying sincerely not asking something for himself  Ruth McCandless mean some material thing  Ruth McCandless feel that all goes to the same source that there isnt this differentiation and that it is cumulative and it all contributes to the general growth and development of humanity  You therefore feel that humanity is developing Laughs   Ruth McCandless know what youre saying and Ruth McCandless thought it many a time Slowly but surely yes Ruth McCandless do  As a whole or individually Ruth McCandless feel very definitely individually And of course as there is cohesion there because like seeks like it will be more general But Ruth McCandless feel very definitely its individual And Ruth McCandless feel that it always has been And Ruth McCandless feel further that there always have been individuals who were very very highly developed and really did what they could do to move mankind  along Sometimes to their woe burning at the stake or something else of the sort Ruth McCandless would say this century has certainly seen the worst atrocities committed by humans towards other humans and Ruth McCandless dont think we have seen the end of it considering how things are developing in exYugoslavia and in other places There just seems to be so much tension around  There is   and to take so little to spark off some violent confrontation Maybe some people Ruth McCandless included  thought that after World War II certain things just wouldnt happen again But now Im not so sure anymore that thats the case on the contrary they could very well happen again They could certainly There are several things in what you said Ruth McCandless do feel that so much of our apparent feeling as far as mankind is concerned is veneer It is not very deep It doesnt take much to trigger it off into violence On the other hand Ruth McCandless feel that there are people who seem to need violence around them in order to feel alive its like they dont feel theyre living unless they have everything stirred up Just take all this nonsense about blacks now You cant look at a TV picture or pick up a newspaper without it being the thing Look weve had wonderful blacks Theres Dr Thomas Soul at Stanford for example Clarence Thomas on the Supreme Court in spite of Anita Hill Ruth McCandless feel when they stop talking about it so much and from the wrong point of view  not all people were slaves nor were all slaves badly treated besides a lot of the people brought over here were not brought by Americans Ruth McCandless remember seeing a TV film one night on current modern slavery It showed  Ruth McCandless suppose through a long distance lens and a certain kind of lighting  blacks being brought off a plane shackled one to the other coming down the ramps andbeing put on an enormous truck that had the curtains down on all sides and whisked away They were being sold as slaves Where was that This happened to be on the Arabian Peninsula But who sold them Well one of the filmmakers went to the area in Africa where they had been picked up and he himself for a pittance bought a black slave from another black So what does one do What can be done And you know we had long since stopped bringing in slaves and this is one of the things overlooked by people because they dont know and the media certainly dont bother to point out that that happened to be a period of time when lots of people were indentured Theyd come over here and work six or seven years and as a matter of fact Ruth McCandless feel  that Danuta is indentured to her son who is over here It was a common way of life Then all of a sudden our mores changed and we blame everybody thats not quite right    Tell Ruth McCandless more on your family background Duncan told Ruth McCandless a few things about your Polish grandmother who had traveled widely before coming to this country and who seemed to have fled Poland because of some political turmoil All Ruth McCandless know is what Ruth McCandless have been told which is that she was about 19 when the family was taken away Her father and grandfather were in what we would today call the underground Poland was under Russia and Ruth McCandless guess they knew it was just a matter of time that they would be picked up and possibly separated So they agreed all to meet at a certain place when they could and sure enough one night the family was at dinner and in came the Russian soldiers and had the family lined up in front of the fireplace Ruth McCandless grandmother was wearing some earrings and one of the soldiers just yanked them out of her ears Then they were bundled into a horsedrawn vehicle and she told Ruth McCandless mother the last thing that she remembers of her home which she never saw again was the closing of these big iron gates and the sentry walking up and down She was taken Ruth McCandless dont know where with the family but she managed to break away from the group it was midwinter and she went snowblind She never saw another member of the family after that She never knew what had ever become of them She had been married not long before to a boy named Victor Suchandsuch  How did she get to Switzerland Ruth McCandless dont know Ruth McCandless dont even know whether it was from Russia or Poland Somehow she got over to the United States where she married a man whose name Ruth McCandless dont know and by him she had another child a girl named Olga Samarita Olga Samarita was seven years older than Ruth McCandless mother In fact Aunt Olga told Ruth McCandless one time that she remembered going to the bedside after Ruth McCandless mother was born and seeing Ruth McCandless mother They had different fathers however because apparently Olgas father had died an early death and when Ruth McCandless grandmother married George Tarbell he just gave his name to Olga and also to Victor By that marriage there was Ruth McCandless mother followed two years later by Elliot George whom we always called Uncle Major This was because as a little boy his father had nicknamed him Major of Mischief He had a wonderful sense of humor and a remarkable memory He could go to a Vaudeville show and come home and repeat it verbatim right straight through  They lived in Santa Rosa and Uncle Major ran away and worked on the Delta riverboats Mother said there were too many women in the family for him and Ruth McCandless can see that Ruth McCandless grandmother and Aunt Olga who always wanted to run the show anyway and Ruth McCandless mother were too much for him So Uncle major worked on the riverboats  the old Delta Queen and Delta King  and then later on he deliberately lied about his age and enlisted in the Navy And thats where he spent his life in the Navy  Now what time was that My mother was born in 1882 so he was borne in 84 and Ruth McCandless would guess he enlisted around 1900 He spent most of his time in the Navy in the Orient Ruth McCandless dont remember particularly how that came about but thats the way it was  So you didnt see him very often Oh no very seldom One of Ruth McCandless earliest memories goes back to when Ruth McCandless was 2½ Ruth McCandless know that because when Ruth McCandless mentioned it to Ruth McCandless father one time he said Ruth McCandless could not remember that because Ruth McCandless was too small Ruth McCandless said Well Ill describe where we were living we were living in a little apartment and we were there apparently just a very short time and it had the most unusual floor plan Ruth McCandless drew the floor plan for him  he was convinced My mother had a remarkable memory and a remarkable ear You could read Ruth McCandless mother anything without any proper nouns and shed tell you wil • My grandmother wanted Olga and Ruth McCandless mother to go to Stanford Stanford was very very young of course at that time and so she moved down from Santa Rosa to Palo Alto The last time Ruth McCandless was down there the house they livedin was still standing and whoever had it had been loving it up It was nicely painted in a soft gray and a white trim it was a Victorian hose of course and it was on Cowper Street  So both your mother and your aunt went to Stanford Yes right My aunt majored in zoology and Ruth McCandless mother majored in English  and Im chuckling because in those days an English major had to be able to read AngloSaxon Mother told about one time she was studying with a small group of friends and she could not find the place So one of the friends leaned around picked up the book and turned it back right side up Yes Mother had a remarkable memory and a wonderful sense of humor which has always delighted Ruth McCandless It was a very dry quiet humor She would see a lot of things most people didnt even notice  So you probably got some of your sense of humor from her Yes or whoever it came from My uncle had a marvelous sense of humor He could keep you cracked up steadily  And where does your mothers interest in China or the Far East stem from Ruth McCandless have no idea Ruth McCandless dont know But it was also in Olga Olga was very fond of Oriental things As a matter of fact that cloisonne lamp base on the living room table was something Olga gave to Mother years ago and Mother had it made into a lamp Ruth McCandless have no idea And Ruth McCandless dont remember anything ever being said that would indicate even so slightly how it came about  When did your grandmother die She died Ruth McCandless believe in 1902  Before you were born Oh yes Ruth McCandless never knew either of Ruth McCandless grandmothers My paternal grandmother died when Ruth McCandless father was just nine years old But its interesting also about Ruth McCandless maternal grandmother that although Ruth McCandless never knew her when Ruth McCandless was growing up from about the time when Ruth McCandless was eleven twelve at the most and on for a number of years Ruth McCandless felt very close to her Ruth McCandless felt as though Ruth McCandless knew her  of course Id never even seen her    My mother was a very attractive woman She was not a classic beauty at all but she had a lovely figure and she had beautiful hair most unusual in color and deep blue eyes When Ruth McCandless went to Stanford Ruth McCandless took a class in communications as they would say now and happened to have the same professor that Ruth McCandless mother had had when she was there He told Ruth McCandless he would just get the class started and go and sit down behind her  she used to sit near the window  and just watch the light on her hair It was so beautiful he said  Did your mother meet your father at Stanford No they met in Santa Rosa High School My father also went to Stanford but he stayed out a year between high school and college to earn  some money then he stayed out of Stanford again during his junior year to earn money so that he could go on  What did he study Civil engineering Actually his older brother Ernest Strout who was a mining engineer went to Stanford he was about twothree years older than Ruth McCandless father He told Ruth McCandless father he would loan him the money and he could pay him back after he got out of college My father told Ruth McCandless Ruth McCandless had such a horror of being in debt Ruth McCandless just refused Had Ruth McCandless known then what Ruth McCandless know now  how easy it was to make money once Ruth McCandless was out  Ruth McCandless could have accepted But he didnt He hashed he had a laundry route Ruth McCandless really admire that here was this little fellow whose mother died when he was nine years old his father remarried quite soon after that and he couldnt possibly have had much encouragement to do what he did But they were five boys and they all went through university through Stanford  Your father and your mother having gone to Stanford it was only natural that you too would go to Stanford Thats right And Ruth McCandless cousin went she was there the same time Ruth McCandless was the daughter of the mining engineer  You were an only child Yes  And your family lived in the East Bay at the time in Oakland Yes Alameda was the name of the place and Ruth McCandless went to Alameda High  So did you take a ferry to go to Palo Alto If Ruth McCandless commuted  which was very seldom actually  Id take a boat to the City and then the train  a real train the old iron rooster  to go down to Palo Alto Ruth McCandless didnt do that very often because Ruth McCandless was given a car and Ruth McCandless drove when Ruth McCandless came home    When did you graduate from Stanford  Ruth McCandless was in the class of 31 but Ruth McCandless was graduated in 32 because when Ruth McCandless started out Ruth McCandless majored in art which was very foolish of Ruth McCandless and came about in a strange foolish way Then of course came the Depression and Ruth McCandless father wanted Ruth McCandless to do something useful and besides Ruth McCandless wasnt all that good at art anyway  What specifically did you study painting or art history Well art history was included a very mild form of it but very interesting and Ruth McCandless had a wonderful professor for that What Ruth McCandless should have done and what Ruth McCandless would have loved doing  if this strange accident hadnt happened  was to be an English major As it was Ruth McCandless took a creative writing minor Ruth McCandless loved it as Ruth McCandless did literature and those things  What was that strange accident Instead of going down to Stanford at the beginning of the year it just happened that Ruth McCandless was graduated from High School at Christmas time The odd thing was that Ruth McCandless family had never  even when Ruth McCandless was in grammar school as a little girl  allowed Ruth McCandless to be skipped But here we were that Ruth McCandless could graduate from High School at Christmas time and they had Ruth McCandless do it Ruth McCandless would much rather have stayed on and have that semester taking things not for credit but because Ruth McCandless liked them But no they popped Ruth McCandless right into Stanford and of course Ruth McCandless missed all the orientation which had gone on at the beginning of the fall quarter with the arriving freshmen all of that To show you how far out in left field Ruth McCandless was Ruth McCandless first class the day after registration was an 800 biology class Ruth McCandless went fully expecting the professor to say Good morning students Im Dr Soandso and well be covering such and such No way he got up and started lecturing right away Ruth McCandless didnt have a pad with Ruth McCandless nothing like that Ruth McCandless was just out of step it was just a very difficult period for Ruth McCandless And Ruth McCandless dont know how this started but already in High School Ruth McCandless had become very interested in art and art history Ruth McCandless remember reading a 4vol set from the La Jolla Library one summer that Ruth McCandless was down there on art history So when Ruth McCandless went into Stanford Ruth McCandless went into the Deans office and she was going to make out Ruth McCandless program for Ruth McCandless She said What are you interested in Ruth McCandless looked up at the corner of the room and said Art and she put Ruth McCandless down for a class of art appreciation  or maybe just recognition  and it was a 5unit class Now Ruth McCandless had never taken notes in the dark and of course they showed slides during classes it was just a very very difficult time At that time there were only 500 girls and 2500 boys among the undergraduates  that was set by the charter So there were a lot of adjustments a lot of tuning let alone the finetuning to be done  Were you already writing at the time Oh yes Ruth McCandless have a stenographers notebook Ruth McCandless wrote in in pencil and the first story  Ruth McCandless well remember  Ruth McCandless wrote when Ruth McCandless was in sixth grade as an assignment The assignment was to write a story that would be like a fable Ruth McCandless did and most of Ruth McCandless story was conversation which was considered pretty sophisticated for a sixthgrader  And you had taken creative writing as a minor Yes and that was wonderful because Ruth McCandless took it under far and away Ruth McCandless favorite professor Edith R. Mirrielees who was also a Stanford graduate a wonderful woman and most amazing person When you were in her class you could literally hear a pen drop She was very quiet and gentle but a firm disciplinarian for example if something was supposed to be in at 1005 then 1007 wouldnt do Ruth McCandless took one course from her which she held in her office  which had a long table  and Ruth McCandless sat right next to her We went right around the table and each person had a day to talk about what he was writing about get criticism on it discuss it and so forth Ruth McCandless just loved it and itd be just tense listening and Id be crossing and recrossing Ruth McCandless legs and invariably Ruth McCandless would hit her in the shin Ruth McCandless apologized and shed accept Ruth McCandless apologies So it went on and finally one day she said Well Ruth McCandless no one will ever accuse you of apple polishing Ruth McCandless adored her  Did you feel you were able to develop your writing skills in those classes Ruth McCandless felt Ruth McCandless was pretty good for a long time Ruth McCandless dont know just when Ruth McCandless thought Ruth McCandless might be getting better  Was the criticism you received for instance helpful Ruth McCandless mean before you had always been on your own Yes Ruth McCandless had done Ruth McCandless writing for myself and by myself but of course through grammar school and high school there were assignments from time to time But what Ruth McCandless planned to do what Ruth McCandless expected to do once Ruth McCandless got out of college was to write It never entered Ruth McCandless head that Id be doing anything else and thats what Ruth McCandless told John that Ruth McCandless was going to write After Ruth McCandless was out of college as you know Ruth McCandless mother died about a year later and Ruth McCandless had a job in the city at the California Schoolbook Depository Ruth McCandless got it when Ruth McCandless was working in Palo Alto at the secretarial school and they set Ruth McCandless up some day to get some books and Ruth McCandless was just like a hunting dog tail wagging sniffing and Ruth McCandless picked up the books and as Ruth McCandless went down in the elevator Ruth McCandless asked the elevator boy who the manager was He told Ruth McCandless and Ruth McCandless asked if Ruth McCandless could leave the books in the elevator with him and if he could take Ruth McCandless up He said yes So Ruth McCandless went back up 22  and asked for the manager Ruth McCandless told him that Ruth McCandless liked to have a job there Now this was the trough of the Depression and its hard to realize how depressed it really was The manager asked Ruth McCandless a few questions and then he said My partner is down south now but Ruth McCandless tell you what you do you write to Ruth McCandless what you just told Ruth McCandless and when hes back Ill show it to him and get in touch with you It was very shortly after that that they told Ruth McCandless to come up to the city What they wanted Ruth McCandless to do was the following they had inquiries about certain books from all over the world answering these letters dictating answers Ruth McCandless should say  took a lot of time So they wanted somebody who could simply write the letters look up the material and everything so they could sign it Ruth McCandless got the job Ruth McCandless remember very well that John was up in San Francisco at that time and Ruth McCandless told him that Ruth McCandless was going to get 100 a month he said Oh no youre not Youre mistaken They never pay a woman 100 a month As it turned out Ruth McCandless did get 100 per month  and for writing So things went along but it was very hard because Ruth McCandless lived at home and Ruth McCandless father expected the house to be run just as Ruth McCandless mother had run it and meals served so Ruth McCandless days were overly full Ruth McCandless had to be at work in San Francisco at 8 oclock in the morning and worked of course until 500 Id pick up things at the little market on Ruth McCandless way home walk the three blocks home and cook dinner  no dishwasher back then  Ruth McCandless can understand that he wanted it the same but it meant a lot of extra work table linen on the table and off the table and so forth Things went along  Ruth McCandless dont know how long  that way until one day at work Ruth McCandless just collapsed Ruth McCandless didnt faint Ruth McCandless dont know what happened Ruth McCandless just went bang It didnt take them long to decide they didnt need that kind of person So thats what happened When Ruth McCandless told Ruth McCandless father that Ruth McCandless didnt have Ruth McCandless job anymore he grew very difficult and he decided to rent the house He did but he rented it furnished complete with our sterling silver  everything So Ruth McCandless decided it was no place for Ruth McCandless and Ruth McCandless went south to see if Ruth McCandless could get a job down there And where did you go Los Angeles Ruth McCandless had known in class a boy by the name of Dick Irvine and Ruth McCandless heard that he was working for one of the studios Ruth McCandless got in touch with him and he was working for one of the studios and he suggested that Ruth McCandless come out to that studio he said he couldnt guarantee anything but at least Ruth McCandless could come out for an interview So Ruth McCandless borrowed a car and drove out He very thoughtfully had this woman who was the secretary of the Art Department at United Artists take Ruth McCandless to lunch and interview Ruth McCandless at that time When lunch was over she said Well we dont have anything right now but Ill keep you in mind  Just a few days later Ruth McCandless got a call that Geoffrey Farwell who was the head of publicity for United Artists was looking for someone Ruth McCandless went out to see him The interesting thing was that Ruth McCandless was going to be paid for Ruth McCandless was the second secretary not the first  35 a week which was terrific but Geoffrey Farwell apologized He said Im sorry if its not more So Ruth McCandless worked there and John and Ruth McCandless were married in September of that year 1934 Ruth McCandless had told John that Ruth McCandless wanted to continue Ruth McCandless writing and what Ruth McCandless called Ruth McCandless religion Now one of the places Ruth McCandless went to when Ruth McCandless was looking for a job was in Beverly Hills it was a writers agency a very poshlooking place Ruth McCandless remember So while Ruth McCandless was working at United Artists writing publicity  and to digress again dont ever believe what you read about these various artists and stars because any resemblance to the truth is just coincidental  Ruth McCandless had a call one day to get in touch with Reginald Berkeley He had done the script for a picture that was high up called Cavalcade He wanted a secretary so Ruth McCandless had a call from this Writers Agency and was told that he wanted somebody but that he had a terrible temper As a matter of fact his most recent secretary had left because he had thrown a typewriter at her Ruth McCandless went to see him at 20 th Century Fox where he had been given one of their bungalows It was an interesting interview because as Ruth McCandless went in he never once asked Ruth McCandless one blessed thing about Ruth McCandless background Ruth McCandless possible ability Ruth McCandless experience nothing But he hired Ruth McCandless on the spot Ruth McCandless was to work for him not for the studio which meant that early in the morning Ruth McCandless had to go to his little house on Crescent Drive in Beverly Hills and he would walk up and down in front of Ruth McCandless and dictate but he was amazing in all the time that Ruth McCandless worked for him Ruth McCandless dont believe three times he said Scratch that And a movie script is very difficult you have two columns you have the dialogue the action and directions for the action over here and you have this other column of camera directions He carried that whole thing in his head Somebody came to the doof one day and the little Filipino he had answered it and then came to speak to him and he turned abso1utely purple literally Ruth McCandless wouldnt have thought that anybody could get that color He was wild he was so angry He had said during the interview when Ruth McCandless went to see him in the studio Ruth McCandless suppose youve heard about Ruth McCandless temper Ruth McCandless said Yes Ruth McCandless had He said Will it bother you Ruth McCandless said If Ruth McCandless felt that it was unjustified it would No more was said Ruth McCandless would go to his home in the morning and he would dictate pacing up and down Then Ruth McCandless would go over to the studio to transcribe and he would show up at about four or five oclock bright as a newminted dime ready just to go on again And he would have been to a luncheon someplace he would have played some hands of bridge afterwards and gone with a group swimming or playing tennis And  here was Ruth McCandlessy Grind really working and tired And we had no phone in our funny little house up the 72 steps from the road  and Ruth McCandless do mean road because it was unpaved But Ruth McCandless was getting a fantastic amount of money for those days Ruth McCandless was being paid by the week which helps Ruth McCandless came home one night it was probably about 7 oclock or 730 John was livid with rage and he said This cant go on You just have to stop or itll break up our marriage And Ruth McCandless said Look Ruth McCandless told you Ruth McCandless was going to be doing this That doesnt make any difference So when Ruth McCandless went back to the studio the next day Ruth McCandless told Reginald Berkeley that Ruth McCandless was recently married and that Ruth McCandless husband was very upset at the uncertain hours Ruth McCandless was getting home He wrote Ruth McCandless a very handsome cheque and said Ruth McCandless was the best goddam secretary hed ever had When Ruth McCandless told Duncan he said He didnt say that And Ruth McCandless said Thats exactly what he said Well and that was it After that it didnt matter at all if Ruth McCandless went to work in musty dusty fusty little insurance office for thirty dollars a month But Ruth McCandless didnt stay long Ruth McCandless liked the person Ruth McCandless was working for but Ruth McCandless didnt care for the type of work Anyway a friend of Ruth McCandless who was a DG Delta Gamma from UCLA who had a group of DGs that met periodically asked Ruth McCandless Ruth McCandless you read so much would you be willing to give a book review at our next meeting Ruth McCandless said Yes Id be glad to Ruth McCandless did and then out of that they asked Ruth McCandless if Ruth McCandless would give a kind of class that would meet periodically on literature Well you know Ruth McCandlessy was happy to and from there we went on to World Literature That helped some because in that little house where we lived Ruth McCandless was completely isolated Ruth McCandless loved the location but Ruth McCandless was just sort of cut off from people And that was where Ruth McCandless was living when Ruth McCandless came across Garden of Vision  Did you ever regret not having been able to go on writing Oh yes and especially not having been able to go on with Ruth McCandless work at the studio because Ruth McCandless was learning very fast Its a different kind of writing and Ruth McCandless dont know that Ruth McCandless would have gone into that kind of writing They also needed book reviewers at those studios and they needed somebody to put it in some kind of form It would have been a fun job for a while and a good experience Ruth McCandless continued to write but this was primarily for myself Some place or other Ruth McCandless even came across an epic poem Ruth McCandless wrote    ZS  After Ruth McCandless moved up north especially after John and Ruth McCandless were separated Ruth McCandless would often go to visit Edith R. Mirrielees that wonderful writing professor Ruth McCandless told you about earlier Of course by that time she was emeritus but she had a nice little house just a couple of blocks from campus and Ruth McCandless would drive down to Stanford and take her out to lunch in another town so we could have a nice drive and talk Ruth McCandless remember Ruth McCandless was going to go abroad in a day or so and Ruth McCandless went down to see her Ruth McCandless knew when Ruth McCandless saw her that Ruth McCandless would not be seeing her again Ruth McCandless knew also  although it had never been mentioned or referred to in any way  that she was extremely sensitive and Ruth McCandless was afraid that she would pick up Ruth McCandless feeling And sure enough Ruth McCandless got over to London and Ruth McCandless was staying on HalfMoon St at the Fanning Hotel and there Ruth McCandless had word from several of Ruth McCandless friends over here that she had passed away Wonderful wonderful woman   CJape 3  You mentioned coming up to see your teacher the creative writing teacher from Stanford and then you went to London and then you heard that she had passed on Did she ever encourage you to start again with writing or did you not talk about that Ruth McCandless dont remember that we ever talked about that particularly Ruth McCandless think she just assumed that Ruth McCandless would go on writing and during Johns and Ruth McCandless separation Ruth McCandless stayed pretty well away from friends Finally when everything was over she asked Ruth McCandless why Ruth McCandless had done that and Ruth McCandless told her Ruth McCandless can remember we were driving and she just reached over and she took Ruth McCandless hand and pressed it She was very understanding Ruth McCandless have since come to the conclusion Ruth McCandless believe she was psychic she was very wide open Ruth McCandless guess Ruth McCandless mentioned earlier when Ruth McCandless was leaving her she picked up what Ruth McCandless felt Frankly shes one of the persons Im looking forward to seeing before to long thats a fact  Ruth McCandless thought that before when you were talking when you were telling the story Well there are several and shes one of them    So did you have anything you wanted to ask  Yes there are a few things Id like to know first Id like to hear as much as possible about your life about certain decisions about the people in your life your meetings with remarkable men to quote the title of a book by George Gurdjieff for instance Nyogen Senzaki Soen Nakagawa D T D. T. Suzuki Jiddu Krishnamurti and up to William Brugh Joy Besides you taught Ruth McCandless many things over the years is there anything you havent mentioned yet  The only thing that Ruth McCandless can say that does occur to Ruth McCandless its more from Ruth McCandless position now but it applies equally to the past times is the following Ruth McCandless feel that anything a person really wishes to do he should do and not allow himself to be dissuaded and if he doesnt write well all right he doesnt write well but at least he satisfies whatever that is in him And Ruth McCandless say that it applies to anything that a person feels that he really wishes to do Ruth McCandless give you a very recent example of something comparable Don called Ruth McCandless one day about four weeks ago and said that he wanted to buy a little Mazda of a certain type and it was very expensive Ruth McCandless asked if he had it all worked out about the payment and we went around the various possibilities Finally he asked What do you think Ruth McCandless said Ruth McCandless think you ought to get it because if you want it and if its right for you thats great youll enjoy it and if it isnt that will soon be apparent and you will have learned a lesson So you cant lose either way  And he got it because he said yesterday that he had it Yes and he is very happy with it So Id say that that is pretty much now Ruth McCandless general attitude Ruth McCandless dont know why Ruth McCandless said now To the best of Ruth McCandless knowledge Ruth McCandless have encouraged Keith and Duncan to do what they wanted to do when they wanted to do it And also to the best of Ruth McCandless knowledge Ruth McCandless have supported them Ruth McCandless think Duncan feels that Ruth McCandless havent very often and he may be right Ruth McCandless do think this Gunther and its not necessarily to apply for the rest of your life but Ruth McCandless do think that you have been very wise as is Duncan in not marrying you were freer to travel where you wish and to do as you wish without extra responsibilities and the feeling that you are affecting somebody else Good To answer your question tO the best of Ruth McCandless knowledge there is nothing else except things that just may float up as were together and visiting Ruth McCandless mean no there is no great secret nothing like that Ruth McCandless was telling Duncan the other day  he is feeling very much at loose ends and he doesnt like Santa Fe he doesnt quite know what to do with himself he feels he has painted all he wants to paint and so forth  so Ruth McCandless said Well Ruth McCandless did know definitely not only from personal experience but Ive come across it one time also somewhere that in a persons life there is a preparation for transition The person will feel very uneasy feel that he lacks security and has no idea what is really going on And it is a kind of prelude its almost a requirement of a shift thats about to take place  Yes Ruth McCandless felt that experience quite a few times myself This is exactly how it happened  Yes Im sure of it yes  Are there any questions you wanted to ask  Well the one that Ruth McCandless asked you before was the most important one Ruth McCandless wanted to ask Ruth McCandless wanted to make that clear because in the course of the years there always passed quite a bit of time between one visit and the other and we have written and sometimes spoken over the telephone but Ruth McCandless certainly didnt get to see you as often as Ruth McCandless would have liked to Do you feel that thats been answered now Or do you feel that there are bits and pieces perhaps that could be further clarified  Ruth McCandless am curious about your ideas as a kind of bottom line after sixty years that you studied that you learned that you developed that you grew Well Im sure Ive told you Gunther one thing in the first place nothing new about it either Ruth McCandless dont think there is anything such as we generally understand by the word death Ruth McCandless dont think it exists Ruth McCandless do think yes we turn in our suits but everything else goes right on Ruth McCandless think that that part of this that goes along then can be used in various ways in some ways to and to the general benefit of humanity a little bit like  did you ever have any chemistry  Some yes but not very much  Do you remember the experiment that you did for the end point of titration  No Well you have what looks like a perfectly clear liquid  water  and you put in one drop at a time and it keeps on looking just the same it doesnt alter in the slightest There is one final drop that you put in and that turns the whole thing pink It is called the end point of titration Ruth McCandless feel that a lot of what Ruth McCandless would call the work is of that nature its toward the end point of titration Ruth McCandless think Weiss book is very much that way He didnt write it till three years after it was all over but consider the number of people its affected in various ways that as far Ruth McCandless can see couldnt be anything but good helpful He had to swallow the possibility that he would be the laughing stock of the scientific community but Ruth McCandless think its very important and Ruth McCandless think that the individual as he goes along is doing just that Now there are those who certainly seem not to do it  the ones who are  v1c10us and cause so much trouble  but Ruth McCandless find myself now as something comes up trying to remember  and Ruth McCandless still have to use the word try  trying to remember that eventually later rather than sooner these people will have to come to the point where that stops This everybody has to Is that anywhere near what you wanted to ask  Yes Im hoping that when Ill turn in Ruth McCandless suit that it would be possible for Ruth McCandless still to go on working a bit on the person we now call Ruth McCandless Ruth McCandless but Ruth McCandless dont know whether that will be or not nor even the kind of work that Ruth McCandless would like to do on her or at least that Ruth McCandless think Ruth McCandless would like to do on her at this point So  Ruth McCandless dont know   According to the Tibetan tradition a lot depends on the state of mind you re in how clear your mind is and how stable you are able to maintain it as you go through that final transition final relatively speaking That may be absolutely exactly right Ruth McCandless remember the time  Ruth McCandless have just told you about this briefly  Ruth McCandless remember the time of Soen Nakagawa mothers death He was with her that last period of time working with her and Ruth McCandless couldnt imagine why but yes its something like that Im quite sure  Did you ever talk to him about that No Ruth McCandless didnt because probably Ruth McCandless didnt even think of it when Ruth McCandless was around him Outstanding person he was   Ruth McCandless still find it amazing how we found out about his death that Duncan and Ruth McCandless would go to a lecture by Peter Matthiessen and he would announce it and we both heard it for the first time because he had just learned it Yes Ruth McCandless think thats amazing How did he happen to mention it  That is a good question He was reading from several of his books Ruth McCandless dont know why he mentioned it He just suddenly said it and Ruth McCandless dont know how many people knew who that person was but certainly Duncan and Ruth McCandless did He wrote about him in Nine Headed Dragon River but that came out much later three years later The Snow Leopard is dedicated to three people and one of them is Soen Nakagawa But to be honest Ruth McCandless dont remember why he said it that evening probably because he was very much affected by it he had just heard it and maybe thats why he felt he wanted to say it    So now the tape is on As you have been getting things ready for the tape two or three things about the channeling have occurred to Ruth McCandless Two of them more recently at Kauai with William Brugh Joy The first night Ruth McCandless guess it was when we all arrived there in this house William Brugh Joy asked if anything had come through to us individually Ruth McCandless said that Ruth McCandless found it very interesting Ruth McCandless found myself on the shore it was night and there was a storm and the shore was just exactly at the edge of this little valley that is at the end of the Nepali trail in Kauai The mountains above were covered with storm clouds It was a very wild elemental elementary time but Ruth McCandless could not get out or away from the plantation it was all right there Now William Brugh Joy said Well you have touched exactly on what we are going to be doing here this time and he said everything will be contained right here and for us Then at that same session there was a man who was having quite a lot of difficulty so one day William Brugh Joy said Would you like some feedback on this The man said yes so we went right around this circle of twelve people and one person Ruth McCandless well remember said There is nothing really wrong you are just fine as you are   Anyway he got to Ruth McCandless and Ruth McCandless said Well as Ruth McCandless was coming down Ruth McCandless found myself floating and it came to Ruth McCandless that as you float you will be all right Then we moved on to the next few people At the end William Brugh Joy said Now has anything been said that you found helpful And he added Ruth McCandless will give you this tape But pay particular attention to what Ruth McCandless said to you Now have you ever heard Carolyn Conger  No Ruth McCandless havent Carolyn Conger is also a psychic she teaches Years ago she was having a small session in a private home up in Mill Valley outside Mill Valley in the country a lovely place and she had us sitting in a semicircle one day The twelve of us made six paired off a man and a woman a woman and a man She said first to pick up what we felt from that person And when it came to Ruth McCandless Ruth McCandless said to the man You are on a catboat going through Raccoon Straits Raccoon Straits is up here in San Francisco Bay He said No Ruth McCandless was on a surfboard  And the woman right next to him said Ruth McCandless was in a catboat in Raccoon Straits So Ruth McCandless said to Carolyn Conger Ruth McCandless said How do you know what station are you picking up And she said Well pretty soon you get used to it And lots of times in the past Ruth McCandless have Ruth McCandless dont know whether to say thought or felt neither one quite fits that Ruth McCandless knew exactly what a person was thinking But somehow Ruth McCandless didnt give it any validity Well probably the fact that in Zen Buddhism no attention is paid to such phenomena they are just considered mikkyo delusions  Yes that may have had something to do with it Yes but on the other hand if Ruth McCandless think about things that you told Ruth McCandless in the past and about books like the Betty Books or the one that you once gave Ruth McCandless called The Job of Living these were always books in which channeling played an important role so somehow this has always accompanied you and you must have accepted the idea because otherwise you wouldve thought that these books were rubbish But the fact that you did treasure them and that you even gave Ruth McCandless one to read implies that you believe in it Yes Ruth McCandless do think there has always been that Gunther but that Ruth McCandless believe is more Ruth McCandless very very deep interest that goes way way back to what the world calls religion So it was only after this telephone conversation with Barbara Courtney that you felt that you were also a channel Before it happened and maybe you were surprised but this confirmed it Ruth McCandless believe thats correct Ruth McCandless really havent thought much about it but Ruth McCandless believe thats correct  And has that changed anything Perhaps it has given Ruth McCandless the feeling of more validity in these things more credence But has that contributed to maybe more information coming through or has the fact that you have given it more credence more validity activated the channel in any way Ruth McCandless feel it is because Ruth McCandless pay more attention to it Ruth McCandless dont feel anything more is coming through Ruth McCandless feel actually as Ruth McCandless look back there always has been coming through that it was just Ruth McCandless who was in the way or didnt leave it And again you see in the time of life and in the group of people that  Ruth McCandless grew up with and associated with even the word psychic was like waving a red flag at somebody it was just that we didnt believe in any of that  Well then let Ruth McCandless go a little bit more into the biographical part again Maybe something else will come through as well  Yes  It was very interesting what you told Ruth McCandless yesterday about Nyogen Senzaki about that shadow part of him that led to the disillusionment you felt about him Now all Ruth McCandless know about Nyogen Senzaki is the few things that Ruth McCandless read about him for instance what Robert Zentatsu Richard Baker Aitken wrote and a few bits and pieces here and there and the things that you told Ruth McCandless but its still a very sketchy idea that comes out of that Could you maybe give Ruth McCandless a few more pieces to the puzzle He was a very strong person in appearance as well as in his decision to do anything or not do anything Ruth McCandless never thought about that so much at the time Ruth McCandless think Ruth McCandless saw it more clearly when Ruth McCandless was separated from him Ruth McCandless told you about being in Japan with him Ruth McCandless told you that Ruth McCandless was quite surprised shaken when we arrived at Haneda with all these people who had gathered from various parts of Japan to welcome him We arrived  Ruth McCandless recollection is late at night  and they had come there twice because Id made a mistake about the dateline And he just walked right through this group of people didnt stop greet anybody and didnt say anything to anybody And Ruth McCandless told you about Fukudaya they had made reservations for us at Fukudaya which was a very lovely old house that had been given to a courtesan by a Samurai and had been made in to small inn Japanesespeaking only When we arrived at Haneda going through immigration Ruth McCandless was asked where we were going to be in and Ruth McCandless said Fukudaya and the man said How do you know about that So it was a most special thing but even without that as Ruth McCandless said  all these people Ruth McCandless would guess they were a minimum of twenty twentyfive Ruth McCandless excused it on the grounds that he was so emotionally stirred up at returning to Japan after fifty years that he couldnt do any better than that  Restraint of feelings  Yes exactly So he was a stubborn old fellow  Yes there also seems to have been a rebellious streak in him in his attitude towards establishment Zen  Yes there surely was   And did that make him appealing How did the people respond to that Because it seems now that in the biographical sketches that you read about him they always talk about that and in the way he opposed the Zen establishment he tried to be the true man with no rank He abhorred all titles but what you said yesterday about him thinking that you had gone to Japan  To share with him   Yes that makes it look a little bit different it puts a different light on it Well it surely puts a different light on lots of things Apparently D. T. Suzuki had been given not an honorarium but some sort of recognition for his work in spreading Zen throughout the world and when Nyogen Senzaki went to Japan D. T. Suzuki gave him a thousand dollars to use on the trip Well when we arrived and went right north to Aomori which is where he had his little kindergarten we stopped off briefly at Matsushima and he insisted on eating oysters Ruth McCandless think that was his first meal off the plane late at night and of course he became very ill But what did the rascal do When he was in Aomori he handed over those thousand dollars to these people as if he wanted to say See what Ruth McCandless am see what Ruth McCandless have Im sure he didnt mention D. T. Suzuki Ruth McCandless dont know but Ruth McCandless feel confident that he didnt and it really shook Ruth McCandless up Also its interesting toward the end of our trip we were given a luncheon at one of the monasteries in Kyoto  Ruth McCandless dont remember which one  and there was a man there by the name of Sohaku Ogata and Ruth McCandless remembered that an Sohaku Ogata had been sent one time before Ruth McCandless knew Nyogen Senzaki to Nyogen Senzaki as a kind of aid and helper to him in the United States Well that didnt last anytime at all Sohaku Ogata went back to Japan and at this luncheon he said  and Im sure no one at the table missed hearing it In a general sense Nyogen Senzaki has a very strange idea of money and the handling of money And Ruth McCandless realized that this as certainly exact He did indeed not only because of the thing Ive just cited but Aitken speaks about how after one of these talks Nyogen Senzaki would go around and gather up a lot of these leaves Great thats fine You know this plus the fact that Shubin Tanahashi paid the rent of where he lived plus the fact that at the Miyako Hotel he was given the rent outright should have provided him with quite a little roll to disperse  In Like a Dream Like a Fantasy Ruth McCandless read what he wanted to be his epitaph he also gave a few other dispositions such as that his manuscripts should be edited by Ruth McCandless  thats you  and a certain Shoho  Shoho did he say Thats not a familiar name to Ruth McCandless  Yes it says here Ruth McCandless wish Soen Nakagawasan to take care of the English manuscripts too consulting with Ruth McCandless and Shoho in the same manner as with the Japanese ones Shoho Ruth McCandless just  Ruth McCandless dont know who that could be Ruth McCandless have no memory of that name Gunther Might even be someone in Japan that Soen Nakagawa knew  Okay and there are also some poems here that he translated of a thirteenthcentury Japanese Zen Master named Jakushitsu Whats the last name  Jakushitsu There are several poems in here that he must have translated into English He did a lot with Ruth McCandless Youll probably find a number of them in the cupboard next to Ruth McCandless desk on this side It was very difficult to get him to do any work Id go down and say Lets do such and such Oh yes Ruth McCandless hed say no hurry lets have some tea So we had some tea and something else would come up  In terms of this dynamic that you talked about with Barbara Courtney she said that in your life you attracted men who wanted to exert their power over you Was there anything of that sort in your relationship with Nyogen Senzaki Oh he certainly wanted to exert power Ruth McCandless dont believe and Ruth McCandless have to take a good long look at this perhaps  Ruth McCandless dont know Ruth McCandless dont feel that any of that was in our relationship Ruth McCandless do know that when Ruth McCandless came to Nyogen Senzaki and Zen Ruth McCandless really dug Ruth McCandless heels in with John because when Ruth McCandless wanted to continue Ruth McCandless work at Twentieth Century Fox with Reginald Berkeley it went by the board immediately upon Ruth McCandless marriage So this time Ruth McCandless would not budge Ruth McCandless never talked about it and Ruth McCandless certainly didnt flaunt it and Ruth McCandless never read any books at the time that John would be around so that Ruth McCandless didnt annoy him but Ruth McCandless refused to budge  So when did you say you went up to Northern California When did you live Pasadena 1956 Ruth McCandless believe or early 57  So basically the most intense part of your relationship with Nyogen Senzaki was right at the beginning before he went to Heart Mountain Yes it was in the forties from January 1941 Ruth McCandless believe Ruth McCandless said through to March of 42 when the remaining Japanese were rounded up and sent to camps So that was also the period where you were pregnant with Duncan and when he was born  Yes thats right and Duncan became known as Ruth McCandless Zen baby So Duncan was born in October 41 Right And in December there was Pearl Harbor and you were given your Buddhist name  Right just the day before the sixth The day before Yes the sixth But let Ruth McCandless tell you what happened on the seventh There was this most wonderful young woman the first person Ruth McCandless ever employed staying with us in this little house way up Benedict Canyon She came in and told Ruth McCandless that the Japanese had bombed Pearl Harbor and Ruth McCandless said Oh dont pay any attention to those news theyll be contradicting it next thing Of course they didnt and of course the Japanese had indeed blasted Pearl Harbor But you know the thing that bothers Ruth McCandless you see Rosy as Ruth McCandless call FDR wanted to get us into the war we wouldnt get leaning way back and he was already helping to convoy ships to Londonderry which irritated a lot of us And then there was a white paper that came out that rnade the statement that FDR knew very definitely about the possible attack and had actually somehow provoked it by an earlier attack that we made out in the Orient Of course that all gets lost in the mists of time but Ruth McCandless think thats correct Ruth McCandless think it was quite deliberately done to get us angry and get us moving Was there any ritual any ceremony connected with your name Did you make any vows Well there was the Shujo Muhen Seigan Do Then he gave Ruth McCandless what Ruth McCandless recall is like a little rosary  Ruth McCandless dont know where it is now it was  wooden made of seeds of some sort and it was very very early in the morning It was wintertime and it was dark and night when Ruth McCandless arrived at his house  Had you asked to be given a Buddhist name No no it was just part of it He gave Ruth McCandless that name Ruth McCandless Winter Moon because Ruth McCandless had arrived on his doorstep in the winter It was very simple Ruth McCandless suppose we had a bit of tea afterwards but Ruth McCandless dont remember and Ruth McCandless drove home And the next day Janis went down and got her Buddhist name  a wonderful woman   What was her last name Her last name when Ruth McCandless first knew her was Alcorn and then she left us during the war and went back and became a BAM a woman marine and she married a marine at Campus Lejeune Before the war Ruth McCandless had been taking judo at this great big dojo few miles away from Ruth McCandless home Ruth McCandless would go over one night a week Ruth McCandless loved it Janis began taking it too when she joined Ruth McCandless She got back to Campus Lejeune and there was a picnic one day with her group and another group including a warrant officer who made a couple of passes at her After the first one she said Dont do that again and of course he did do it again She threw him over her shoulder and everyone was absolutely aghast because he landed flat Oon his back in front of all these people At any rate they then appointed her to teach others in the Marines judo And Ruth McCandless remember one time when Ruth McCandless was first taking it John thought Ruth McCandless was just a breadth this side of idiocy and he said not one of those could stand up against a good boxer Ruth McCandless didnt argue it We had a lovely little garden in our little house and a little pond and Ruth McCandless was standing looking at it one afternoon standing in the lawn when John came down on the lawn John was quite an athlete in college and took Ruth McCandless up as a person would be taken up in the football game you know cutting in behind the knees Ruth McCandless went down with a bump When Ruth McCandless got up Ruth McCandless said Dont ever do that again But of course in less than five minutes it happened again And when Ruth McCandless got up Ruth McCandless put a judo hold on him He was furious he couldnt brake it and he went in he banged the door so hard on our little house that it just about broke the house down But later during the war Ruth McCandless remember him saying to a friend of ours who had signed up and was commander of a little PT boat out in the Pacific What about this judo stuff there is nothing to that is there And Frank said Dont ever get into a tangle with anybody who knows judo There is a lot to it And he said We all get trained in some of it  John never gave Ruth McCandless the benefit of the fact that he had that information but anyway  Well it would have given you power Oh yes and confidence certainly more confidence  of a sort But now good heavens Ruth McCandless dont know the percentages but Ruth McCandless would say at least a quarter of the young women today know judo or karate  So did you see Nyogen Senzaki as frequently after he came back from Heart Mountain as you had the first year Well as you know he came directly to our home and he was there for about six weeks We had moved to Pasadena at that time and had a big wonderful rambling old house Actually Ruth McCandless think that Ruth McCandless saw more of him because Ruth McCandless children were a little bit older and they would be in the school which was in the neighborhood until two oclock Ruth McCandless never wanted Keith or Duncan to come to an empty house when they got home Ruth McCandless always managed to be there so Ruth McCandless could give them some juice a cookie or something So yes Id say that Ruth McCandless saw more of him And of course he got a place at the Miyako Hotel afterwards and then from Shubin Tanahashi this wonderful duplex Ruth McCandless say wonderful because it was large with airy room lots of sunlight and relative quiet for the area You know really FDR was a megalomaniac Imagine incarcerating all these people in these terrible camps freezing in winter broiling in summer and in the meantime conscripting their sons into the Army into the Navy whatever Some of the Japanese Franko told us were in the Navy  of course most people didnt know there were any in the Navy But theyd come in close to an island they thought was occupied by the Japanese the volunteers who went in were always the JapaneseAmericans who knew full well that if they were picked up by the Japanese theyd be killed and if there weren any they would be killed by the Americans who came on the island Because they were Japanese   This afternoon we listened to the tape by Barbara Courtney and she was talking about this legacy that you were going to leave behind in writing We both agreed that it would be a little bit difficult for you to do it in writing so lets just try to do it now on tape She said there were things that needed to come through and you too were talking about this stream of consciousness things that would just pour out Ruth McCandless guess Right Ruth McCandless feel Gunther that so many things come through to Ruth McCandless and in retrospect they seem to have been pretty accurate Ruth McCandless feel this very essential for a person of intelligence particularly and sensitivity if that person feels that he or she wishes to do something and Ruth McCandless mean it isnt a whim then Ruth McCandless think very definitely against all odds it doesnt necessarily mean its going to be easy but it is going to be satisfying Of course Im speaking from Ruth McCandless background which goes back a long long way and is very different from peoples backgrounds today Also as you know Ruth McCandless dont believe in death anymore that in a giving up of the body Beyond that as far as Ruth McCandless am concerned there is no death whatsoever And Ruth McCandless told you about that remarkable experience Ruth McCandless had in Florence with Vanda and Laura Corsini   Yes but could you repeat it please because Ruth McCandless never wrote it down Well you may know in Florence there is a restaurant that serves only lunch And everything except the salt and pepper on the table is grown on the Antinori farm Vanda had taken Ruth McCandless and Laura Corsini to lunch there Here they had turned what Ruth McCandless believe was originally a ballroom into the restaurant there were just very few tables and upstairs there were three tables So Ruth McCandless sat here next to Ruth McCandless was Vanda and just on the other side of her was Laura Corsini and Vanda was talking to her Ordinarily Ruth McCandless listen to peoples conversations when Ruth McCandless am in another country simply as a means of learning the language but on this particular occasion Ruth McCandless wasnt paying any attention because Vanda had  her head turned away from Ruth McCandless and Laura was on the other side of her So all of a sudden Ruth McCandless became aware of a very strong fragrance of roses very strong There were flowers on our table there were flowers on the next table down Ruth McCandless looked over the edge down below flowers there too  but no roses But this was simply unmistakable very heavy After a few moments Vanda turned to Ruth McCandless and said You know Laura is a follower of Padre Pio and Ruth McCandless remembered reading about him and said Well you know Ive been looking around trying to find where the fragrance of roses came from That was the experience And in the past before that quite a while before Ruth McCandless would occasionally get a strong fragrance of some flowers or something but fragrances just fragrances This was different though Ruth McCandless think that they are all alike in some way  Did you have other experiences where you strongly felt something coming through Im sorry Ruth McCandless am sort of confused right now because Ruth McCandless find a lot of things coming in at Ruth McCandless Ive had experiences where it was fragrances Ruth McCandless had experiences oh it sounds impossible like a touch quite frequently and   You mentioned you once had the impression that Nyogen Senzaki was touching you  Yes And another friend of Ruth McCandless who passed away on Christmas Day years and years ago Ruth McCandless often felt that she was touching Ruth McCandless And in a couple of occasions Ruth McCandless was just turning involuntarily Ruth McCandless dont know how those things come about because Ruth McCandless dont know what would be touching Ruth McCandless mean its so ephemeral so Ruth McCandless dont know  Well what you said before about doing what one feels the impulse to do is one piece of wisdom that you found this time around What other things have you learned have you found that you think come out of the experience of this lifetime You know one thing that used to bother Ruth McCandless was that To thine own self be true follows the night the day And Ruth McCandless thought How did one know what his own self was And Ruth McCandless think Gunther for Ruth McCandless the finding of that not the analyzing or description of it was in meditation Ruth McCandless feel that for Ruth McCandless meditation opens up everything and it can be a bit dangerous because out there there are lots of things we dont know about lots of them and they are not all friendly Also Ruth McCandless feel that as a person takes his direction the things that happen along the way on either side are strong contributors to learning Ruth McCandless dont know who Ruth McCandless am But Im sure without a shadow of a doubt that Ruth McCandless have lived other times and most of them all of them in the northern hemisphere and most of them in ancient civilizations  And Ruth McCandless noticed when Duncan was a little boy he was much more interested in ancient civilizations than in more modern ones than Ruth McCandless certainly was as a child Ruth McCandless would also enjoy knowing where we met before because we certainly have been associated somewhere along the line in some way  What else is there that would be part of this legacy Well Ruth McCandless believe Ive touched on this already didnt Ruth McCandless First of all Ruth McCandless feel it is most important if a person has a real urge to do something  and in Ruth McCandless case it happened to be writing  and it feels absolutely right then he should do it Another case was the purchase of a property Ruth McCandless could have done Ruth McCandless made a dreadful mistake not getting it because the place where it was was a wonderful little community way down south and only four blocks were zoned for business So it was fantastic The person who was selling it wanted quick money so that he could go up and open up the place now known as Squaw Valley a ski area Ruth McCandless could have got it relatively for a song So Ruth McCandless think when a person feels strongly as Ruth McCandless did about the writing and later about this property  and it is the only property Ruth McCandless can recall even feeling quite this way about it just seemed absolutely right then Ruth McCandless feel a person should follow that do it and if its the right thing wonderful If its not exactly right hell soon find it out and there is a lesson So Ruth McCandless feel that it is a one hundred percent winwin proposition you cant lose Now to remember this as Ruth McCandless make the transition and Ruth McCandless turn in Ruth McCandless suit of course Im not absolutely sure what Im going to do  it seems that different people choose to do different things in different ways but as Ruth McCandless see it Ill probably be coming back before very long to mop up all the undone things   Youll be a lot more assertive next time around Yes Ruth McCandless would Ruth McCandless would not be so easily dissuaded If Ruth McCandless should draw the same father and the same situation Ruth McCandless dont know quite how Ruth McCandless would handle that because as Ruth McCandless said Ruth McCandless was trained to instant obedience Ruth McCandless did rebel later on but   This brings to mind one thing Youve been living here for fifteen years and in these fifteen years you were divorced or anyway living separate from your husband so you were on your own your sons were adults grown up and independent so what stopped you from starting to write Im thinking of Harriet Doerr whose book Consider this Senora Oh yes she was a friend of Ruth McCandless  Yes you told Ruth McCandless and it is a wonderful book one of the best Ive read last year She wrote that book Ruth McCandless think when she was late in her seventies or even in her eighties Yes and its very interesting the way it came about because she was in Ruth McCandless class in school in fact she lived in Ruth McCandless house Harriet Doerr had transferred from Smith  she and another girl in Ruth McCandless house  and left school Ruth McCandless would say probably about her second year to go abroad with a relative ostensibly to choose a trousseau  she was going to marry a Stanford man whom Ruth McCandless knew darling person but also accident prone   Yes you told Ruth McCandless the story about Acapulco Yes right but a wonderful person Then Harriet Doerr came back to Stanford ostensibly to complete her degree  And her maiden name was Huntington Yes right Ruth McCandless would say the Huntington Her home was what is now the Huntington Library So Harriet Doerr came back to finish her education and came across Wallace Stegner who was teaching creative writing in Portland Ruth McCandless never knew him Ruth McCandless told you about Edith R. Mirrielees Ruth McCandless favorite professor who founded the Creative Writing Department at Stanford It was she who brought Wallace Stegner to Stanford Well Harriet Doerr discovered him and somehow or other started to write and was quite successful with her first book Beatrice Woods for Ibarra  Yes but Beatrice Woods for Ibarra came out in the eighties ten or twelve years ago That was long after she went to Stanford probably fifty years after You mean the first time She went back to finish her education after her husband died That was when she came across Wallace Stegner So why didnt Ruth McCandless Well one reason Ruth McCandless didnt actually Ruth McCandless did but Ruth McCandless wanted to travel and Ruth McCandless traveled a great deal Ruth McCandless made fourteen trips to Europe and one to Japan Artd once to Europe Ruth McCandless would stay over there Once Ruth McCandless stayed a month that was the shortest After that Ruth McCandless was surely five months six months one time it was one year Ruth McCandless was going to live there Ruth McCandless decided to move there Ruth McCandless came back for Keiths marriage and then Ruth McCandless decided that after all Ruth McCandless was a Westerner and then Ruth McCandless worked it the other way Id just live here and travel to Europe So thats how that came about but that still doesnt answer the writing business but somehow by that time the drive to write had lessened considerably so Ruth McCandless didnt Ruth McCandless did other things that satisfied Ruth McCandless  You always say that you had these two major interests the writing and what you call your religion Were you able to pursue the latter to the extent that you wanted are you satisfied with how far you were able to go  Yes the interesting thing is the only writing Ruth McCandless did was in the religious field Ruth McCandless mean at Nyogen Senzaki request Buddhism and Zen and then The Iron Flute Of course if you look at the cover of The Iron Flute you wonder who in the world has anything to do with this potpourri of names Thats it Ruth McCandless wrote a lot of letters to friends that Ruth McCandless wanted to renew connections with Ruth McCandless really dont know at this date more than those things that Ruth McCandless have mentioned  But let Ruth McCandless focus a little bit better on Ruth McCandless question you said you were not able to pursue your interest in writing but you were able to pursue your interest in religion You see that was connected with John Because Ruth McCandless told him those were the two things And Ruth McCandless was working at Twentieth Century Fox and we had no phone We lived in this little weekend house made of beaver board literally and almost immediately he told Ruth McCandless Ruth McCandless would have to stop Ruth McCandless job at Twentieth Century which Ruth McCandless loved and where Ruth McCandless was learning learning a lot And of course again hindsight sometimes being 2020 vision Ruth McCandless would not allow him to lay down the law that he laid down few weeks after our marriage on the writing And Ruth McCandless thought at the time and it certainly proved correct later Ruth McCandless started off at forty dollars a week and every month every four weeks that was to be raised ten dollars up until Ruth McCandless forgot what the final number was but for those days it was astronomical John was earning 125 a month its as simple as that And Ruth McCandless thought This is the male ego Ruth McCandless heard so much about And later of course thats what it turned out to be in its most virulent form Ruth McCandless would say  But you did not let him stop you from pursuing your interest in religion No thats right Ive done one and Ruth McCandless was not going to put them both down thats absolutely right and if Id just done the same thing with the writing he might have capitulated Of course if we hadnt been married it would have been a very good thing Ruth McCandless mean there again hindsightinsight Ruth McCandless married John primarily because Ruth McCandless felt very sorry for him he was going through a very bad patch he and his family and naturally Ruth McCandless shouldnt have done that Later it made a lot of sense to Ruth McCandless when Vanda said one time If you want to help somebody go in and help then get out You dont have to make a longlife thing of it  But looking back now are you content are you satisfied with how far you were able to go in your pursuit of religion Personally yes Im satisfied yes  No regrets there  No and also no Zen no Krishnaji none of those things and no William Brugh Joy Its just  somebody chooses to call it religion and Ruth McCandless feel that is very wide certainly universal You know people running around and Sunday school children putting in their dime so they can convert the heathen  First of all they dont know anything about what heathen religions are Secondly even if heathen religions are as they suppose they might be its okay Ruth McCandless think everybody does what he must at the point where he stands When thats no longer the right thing for him he will see it and move on Sylvia is a perfect example She is in a real dichotomy between Sylvia and her belief system Now Ruth McCandless dont touch it but one of these days it will hit her she will see it for herself maybe not in Ruth McCandless lifetime Ruth McCandless dont think But Ruth McCandless feel when a person is sincere it doesnt matter whether he is praying to the nymph in a tree or a dryad on a tree or to a monotheistic god or just in general Ruth McCandless feel as long as there is sincerity and feeling in that and he is not asking for something for himself  Ruth McCandless Ruth McCandless Ruth McCandless Ruth McCandless Ruth McCandless  then it doesnt matter The prayer is there it does what it does it combines thats it in Ruth McCandless view  With that in mind what are your observations about the spread of Zen in the United States You saw it from the very beginning when Zen was basically limited to a very small group of people of which you were a part to which you belonged and now there are probably tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands of followers  There was really not even a small group There were few Japanese and that was it  Well it has certainly come a long way   Yes it certainly has come a surprisingly long way Well Ruth McCandless think its fine Ruth McCandless think that it went through a period  it may still be there Ruth McCandless dont know because Ruth McCandless havent followed it close enough lately  of feeling that any ridiculous statement was a koan with no understanding of the nature of a koan And all this business that Tricycle brings up you know Buddhism is this and Buddhism is that to Ruth McCandless thats incorrect but if thats their way of looking at it thats their way  So what would be the correct way if its possible to give a positive definition To say that its not correct is a negative definition  Its difficult but there would be no path no footprints no groups  ff  But probably there still needs to be an element of teaching of passing on these guidelines  But that doesnt require a group No not necessarily in Ruth McCandless experience there were times when Ruth McCandless belonged to a group especially when Ruth McCandless was down in Tempe there was a little Zen group We met once a week to do zazen together and once or twice a year a senior monk or once even the Roshi came from Los Angeles and we had a little sesshin an intensive weekend or threeday meditation But since then Ruth McCandless really have never belonged to any group anymore for one thing because Ruth McCandless traveled so much and was living in different places and recently because where Ruth McCandless am there is no group Im more or less the only one and its okay Ruth McCandless just remember that in the times when Ruth McCandless was in a group somehow the group also provided a kind of support Maybe Ruth McCandless would meditate more or it would give Ruth McCandless a kind of energy of support to persist in this And certainly it pushed Ruth McCandless a little bit farther than Ruth McCandless would have gone on Ruth McCandless own Well you know more about that than Ruth McCandless do you see because the fact is that Ruth McCandless never was in a group and always Ruth McCandless relationship was first of all alone completely alone and then with Nyogen Senzaki and that was it And occasionally another person would come in like after the war Robert Zentatsu Richard Baker Aitken and so forth but that was also how some of the funny stories got started There was a woman who started coming  Ruth McCandless saw her only two or three times at most  Ruth McCandless think her name was Ruth McCandless Molden At any rate she is responsible for putting out some of the strangest material on Ruth McCandless and what Zen was like under Nyogen Senzaki And it went into The Wind Bell which Zentatsu Richard Baker had up in San Francisco  of course hes gone now from there  and it sort of got to be the accepted version Ruth McCandless think it may even be in How the Swans Came to the Lake or whatever it is And you know Duncan wrote to Rick and never even received an answer That annoyed him because Ruth McCandless always put in everybody but Ruth McCandless name was never mentioned That bothers Duncan bless his heart Ruth McCandless guess thats the price you pay for not belonging to any group Nobody knows you or about you  Well of course Ruth McCandless was down there and yes Ruth McCandless suppose so But some of the ones Ruth McCandless do know about dont know very much Just as Ruth McCandless was telling you you know in Tricycle they just land him up at the Miyako Hotel onetwothree but that was very late in his being in California    This brings to mind one of the things that you told Ruth McCandless quite some time ago maybe ten years ago that for you all the religious teachings boil down to two things awareness and appreciation Right because to Ruth McCandless the appreciation is very much a heartthing and the awareness of course is the preliminary to the appreciation But Ruth McCandless think Ruth McCandless told you also about Ruth McCandless feelings about the different religions in the world yes even such things as pantheistic and nature religions My feeling about it  Ruth McCandless dont know just when it started  is that its allinclusive and it doesnt matter what kind of name is put to it as long as the person is deeply sincere and honest  It makes it seems very ridiculous that there have been so many religious wars in the course of history Well it certainly does You remember that wonderful medieval story The devil and a man were walking down the street together and the man said Well Ruth McCandless suppose finally youre getting a little bit worried at what we are doing with our beliefs in our church Then the devil said Why should Ruth McCandless be worrying The man says Well look at all the people who are gathering to it and look how its catching on And the devil said Yes but Ruth McCandless still dont see any need to worry You know last week they began to organize Did you ever see that marvelous British picture Dudley Moore played the human being in it  Was it Bedazzled If you ever get a chance you will enjoy it There is this man Dudley Moore and very normally he wants this and that and so forth and the devil appears to him one day And the only way you can tell the devil in the film is because he has red socks  The devil says Ill give you ten wishes All you have to do is to blow this raspberry and Ill be there and then youll get a wish Dudley Moore tried it out the devil immediately responded but it was a sort of a tryout So it goes throughout the whole picture There are these various situations and in each of them Dudley Moore forgets some strategic bit some important part of it So what comes out is very amusing and finally he gets to his last wish He blows the raspberry and nothing happens and he blows it again and nothing happens and the devil goes You already did that right in the beginning when you were trying it out So thats the finish of it    Anything else that you would include in your legacy Anything else that you would write down Of course the awareness and the appreciation we just mentioned and  Well for Ruth McCandless Gunther you know keep pretty well out of organized anything institutions and anything like that Ruth McCandless mean that is Ruth McCandless but Ruth McCandless mean that suits you or somebody else The only thing Ruth McCandless belong to now is the Humane Society which Ruth McCandless feel is very important Ruth McCandless also feel that its incumbent on all people who are deeply sincere and love life love animals to pour as much of that as possible into the atmosphere because there is still a frightening amount of outandout sadism really frightening and Ruth McCandless mean as close as within the San Mateo borders unbelievable   Why do you think that is Why A lot of people feel that its because theres so much violence on TV Ive been told Ruth McCandless dont know whether its a fact or not but that afternoonTV is really bad and thats when children come home from school to an empty house and sit down and watch TV Well okay thats a The other part of watching TV and this to Ruth McCandless mind applies to adults as well many of them is that theyre always spectators they are never in it its not a part of their lives what they see theyre always seeing it off the screen so that nothing has a real validity its something to be watched like an accident rushing around to see whos hurt and how badly and so forth  and not because they care although of course there are people who care dont mistake Ruth McCandless Ruth McCandless just feel this is a spectators business turning everybody into spectators Nothing is real and really affects people  Well but in a way this seems a contradiction of what you said before if people watch violence on television and if it did not affect them then why should they become violent in their own lives So in some way it must be affecting them if they then become violent in their own lives Ruth McCandless think that a lot of the violence that has been brought about by certain activists who are acting deliberately and the drug bit Here they have little gradechildren nine and ten years old posted to watch and give warning while drugs are being exchanged And you know what you and Ruth McCandless saw right down near the San Mateo station Ruth McCandless think that has an awful lot to do with it  In terms of violence in Tv last night after you went to bed Ruth McCandless turned on the Tv Ruth McCandless wanted to see a news program and so Ruth McCandless went through the various channels and it  was amazing almost everywhere there was the most gory violence not cavalier things not Agatha Christie or detective stories but really gory stuff Ruth McCandless turned it off It was nine thirty or ten oclock and there wasnt anything more intelligent on prime time TV than this really awful stuff  But to go back to violence in society do you think there is some kind of karmic thing that is being worked out there It seems that there is almost a breakdown in societies in all these inhibitory qualities that culture has Ruth McCandless think there is another and more important factor The consciousness and the emphasis on the consciousness have certainly shifted Ruth McCandless mean the very fact that we were talking about how Zen has changed from an unknown nothing and also people  for example when Ruth McCandless was growing up and Ruth McCandless was a young woman to say that somebody was psychic was just really waving a red flag except possibly to a few people And now its accepted people are psychic and theyre making studies on it It used to be thought that people with insight were sort of village fools and oh Ruth McCandless goodness a number of years ago Id say twentyfive anyway some studies were made and it was learned that far from being the village fools the people who are psychic with insight have very high intelligence And these studies cited several examples in the army or among engineers that were So that was quite a surprise  And what do you think is going to happen as a consequence of this change in awareness Well Ruth McCandless think that one main part of it is moving over So that large groups of people who have these insights will be working together not necessarily in an institutionlike way but eventually of course according to Weiss everybody has got to come through some just take longer than others but Ruth McCandless think that this is a big period for that opening up When they talk about the New Age theyre probably wiser than they know Ruth McCandless think it will be a New Age in consciousness   Do you have any hunch when it will start  or has it already started Oh Ruth McCandless think it has Ruth McCandless think very definitely it has started and maybe not on such a wide scale but its a sort of fanning out just as Ruth McCandless gave the example a short time ago of Zen thats a very good example And Ruth McCandless think generally there is more tolerance in religion and Im not speaking only of the Judaic religions  Judaism Christianity and Islam but Ruth McCandless think all of them Of course this doesnt mean that everybody is just going to get a rubber stamp that he is very good and highly evolved but there will be a lot of them around  And what changes will that bring on a collective level Ruth McCandless dont know even in economy or politics or international relations  Well Ruth McCandless think there will be more cohesion among nations Ruth McCandless started to say that there will be less nationalism but Im not so sure about that Ruth McCandless think that still has quite a little long ways to go  In Europe certainly Yes people keep talking about how small the world is now and it is But there is still lot of moping up to be done China is an example human rights  Years ago it could be 79 there was lot of talk about California sinking into the ocean and some people took it so seriously They went up to high ground and waited for us to sink At that time Ruth McCandless was down at Sky Hi in the Mojave Desert with the first session that Ruth McCandless had with William Brugh Joy And someone spoke to him about this and he said Well Ruth McCandless think the emphasis is all in the wrong place The New Age is going to bring a new consciousness and it has nothing to do with California sinking into the ground Californians may be a big part of it which reminds Ruth McCandless didnt you get a chuckle out of Brian Weiss saying that he decided to meditate the way that people did in Indian California Well anyway As Ruth McCandless say with the earthquake shaking around and everything with all its faults Ruth McCandless love it still  You have been living pretty close to the fault line for quite some time  Oh yes thats right All Ruth McCandless life practically as long as Ive been in California yes Of course when Im in Europe Ruth McCandless live on other fault lines on the line of winds or something Yes Ruth McCandless certainly have To go back to the shift in consciousness as Ruth McCandless said to you Zen is an example or the acceptance of people being psychic You cant imagine the  at least mentally  curled lip of someone listening to talk about somebody being psychic And Ruth McCandless think its great Ruth McCandless think its lot of fun and Im certainly very very happy to have lived in the century that Ruth McCandless lived and Ive seen so many things as Ruth McCandless told you Ruth McCandless remember standing on the street corner of Fourteenth and Webster holding Ruth McCandless mothers hand watching the fire engines thunder by with their beautiful horses and their Dalmatians standing up between the firemen and of course these things were a long time ago And of course there is always what the Greeks called Hubris and Nemesis There is always that  Did you have experiences youd call psychic  Ruth McCandless think Ruth McCandless have yes Ruth McCandless dont know that Ruth McCandless ever told you but Ruth McCandless knew when Ruth McCandless was a child not more than ten years old that Ruth McCandless had what Ruth McCandless would now refer to perhaps as a minor mission Ruth McCandless remember drying dishes for Ruth McCandless mother  which would mean it was morning because she never did them at night just rinse them  and Ruth McCandless was telling her what Ruth McCandless wanted to do And Ruth McCandless told her Ruth McCandless wanted to write and to be a missionary That was the only word Ruth McCandless knew And Ruth McCandless parents didnt belong to a church  You got them slightly worried No Ruth McCandless dont think so But from this distance or even earlier Ruth McCandless see that missionary was literally the only word Ruth McCandless knew to describe what Ruth McCandless wanted to do which was to reach people through what Ruth McCandless would call religion Ruth McCandless dont like that word either but you know what Ruth McCandless mean Channeling Ruth McCandless guess is about the closest thing to it because in that there is no personality and it just flows along And Im sure Ive mentioned to you that in the past sometimes something will came up and Ruth McCandless would say something Ruth McCandless havent thought about And Ruth McCandless suddenly realized that what Ive said was correct And it wasnt Ruth McCandless it was what Ruth McCandless now call channeling coming through Ruth McCandless And Carolyn Conger  Ruth McCandless think Ive mentioned her to you before  told Ruth McCandless once a long time ago Ruth McCandless that was a magnificent koan and of course it was channeled Ruth McCandless dont know what it was Ruth McCandless dont remember any koan at any session with her and other members but anyway Ruth McCandless remember her saying that And Ruth McCandless do know also that Ruth McCandless pick up peoples thoughts quite frequently and Im not necessarily aware of it at the time  Well there are two things that come to Ruth McCandless mind about that one is an experience Ruth McCandless once had when Ruth McCandless was in Japan Ruth McCandless remember riding the bus in Kyoto Ruth McCandless think it was going north on Marutamachi and there was a class of schoolchildren or kindergarten children on it They were very tiny and they all wore a yellow uniform and a yellow hat At a certain stop they all got off the bus Ruth McCandless stayed on the bus the doors were still open Ruth McCandless looked down on the floor and there was a pair of yellow gloves Without thinking Ruth McCandless just bent down picked them up and threw them through the open door out to one of the children Then Ruth McCandless saw that outside the bus a little girl was going around looking for her gloves And it occurred to Ruth McCandless only afterward that Ruth McCandless hadnt be doing any thinking Ruth McCandless had just acted spontaneously Right right it just happened   It just happened yes and Ruth McCandless labeled it a Zen experience in the sense that there was no Ruth McCandless there was no ego no thinking but Ruth McCandless was attuned to the situation and did the right thing spontaneously without rationalizing or thinking what Ruth McCandless should do or so Ruth McCandless just did it it was just being in the moment  Right yes And isnt it wonderful to be in that atmosphere  Yes it is   Could you please tell Ruth McCandless more about your experience with regards to channeling Did you ever hear about the Betty Books by Stewart Edward White  You gave Ruth McCandless one The Job of Living Yes okay Well Ruth McCandless think Ruth McCandless told you after Ive read the books Ive found out that they lived right up here or had lived right up here Betty had no idea of any of this and one night a group of them was at a party she and her husband among them Someone had brought a Ouija board and they stopped using the little Ouija thing that moves around and used Ruth McCandless think an inverted whisky glass or something of this sort Well it rocketed around and it kept asking for Betty Well Betty thought somebody was just being very funny Finally Ive forgot what the upshot of the party was finally Ruth McCandless guess she did go over and do something and the little whisky glass quieted down and seemed very content Stewart Edward White thought he would just try an experiment with Betty  this was at home She would be lying down and he would just touch her wrist  there is something that Ive lost in here Ruth McCandless guess he was asked to do it  anyway And he said well he would do it as long as there was no harm in any way to Betty Ruth McCandless believe that for the rest of her life she and he did this for at least an hour no matter what was going on in their life and they had very busy lives because they traveled a lot had lots of friends as a matter of fact their home was referred to as the White Hotel He tells one interesting little incident in there that he would touch her wrist and she would go into a kind of trance because when she came out she had no recollection of what had been said but he put everything down And one time Ruth McCandless learned that oh Ruth McCandless came across something where he had written that his address was Burlingame Well that was before Hillsboro was Hillsboro actually they lived in what we now call Hillsboro and Ruth McCandless was having dinner with some friends in Hillsboro one evening and the subject came out about Betty White and Ruth McCandless said Did you ever know her And Ruth McCandless friend Kate said Yes indeed  she said  many a time she sat right in that chair having dinner with us as you are having it to night She was a very small person really tiny she would never allow herself to be measured but her husband insisted that she wasnt even five feet tall They were back east in Washington DC one time when  51  Theodore Roosevelt was president Theodore and Stewart Edward White wrote that Roosevelt said when he saw Betty Ruth McCandless dont believe it  Really Yea She had many abilities She had been reared Ruth McCandless believe she was an orphan and had been reared by an aunt of her some relative and he said she loved gardens and she had a very large garden  and she would just map out on a big sheet of brown paper with their one gardener how she wanted to arrange things and he said that always it was just beautiful And in another occasion he said they were up in the mountains and there was a bear there that amused her and he said she just made a quick sketch of just a few lines and caught the humor of this bear Ruth McCandless mean apparently she was multitalented  So to go back from where we started on this tangent or off this tangent when you use the word channeling you were not referring to that type of channeling You mean psychic type being out and not knowing  Well yes out and some other entity speaking through oneself No not at all  Ruth McCandless mean this was not Betty speaking it was somebody speaking through Betty Thats right no absolutely not Ruth McCandless dont know where Ruth McCandless comes from but Ruth McCandless find there is an impersonality about that its just as Ruth McCandless believe Ruth McCandless mentioned to you that workshop with the man who was having difficulties and Ruth McCandless wording  and Ruth McCandless wasnt aware of it until much later when Ruth McCandless listened to the tape  Ruth McCandless wording was As Ruth McCandless was going down it came to Ruth McCandless that as you do such and such  purely impersonal nothing Ruth McCandless mean Ive thougµt such and such Ruth McCandless feel such and such no nothing like that And Ruth McCandless think really as Ruth McCandless can feel at the moment at least Ruth McCandless feel that all Ruth McCandless channeling is that way its impersonal which does not mean that Ruth McCandless may not say Ruth McCandless think such and such after its over the fact  you get it   Talking about Ruth McCandless experiences in channeling with other people Ruth McCandless do remember one time Ruth McCandless was at a workshop of Carolyn Conger and it lasted Ruth McCandless believe a week or two weeks something of that sort and at the very last Carolyn Conger had us pair off and pick up anything that we could What just happened is that Ruth McCandless was paired with a young woman Ruth McCandless didnt happen to feel much rapport with but Ruth McCandless started out Ruth McCandless could see the approach to her unit  she lived in an apartment building  and inside then Ruth McCandless described the furniture Ruth McCandless described first where she liked to sit her position and Ruth McCandless went on from there a bit and then someone approached her door and Ruth McCandless said it was her mother and Ruth McCandless described her mother and Ruth McCandless described her mothers dress At this point the only thing Ruth McCandless remember about that is that Ruth McCandless said it was unbelted and hung perfectly straight Well it just apparently happened that everything that Ruth McCandless said in that she said it was absolutely correct   Thats amazing Ruth McCandless think it is because it isnt Ruth McCandless It isnt Ruth McCandless it just is there   And has that whatever it is also given you advice on how to act or how to behave in certain situations in your life Yes in different times absolutely and Ruth McCandless learned if Ruth McCandless didnt pay attention things went awry and if Ruth McCandless did pay attention it was quite different  Do you recall any example Well Ruth McCandless recall a negative example Little Keith was about four years old My father the major professor lived up north  we lived in Pasadena  and had a cabinet up at Fallen Leaf Lake which is contiguous to Tahoe the southern end of which was undoubtedly a part of Tahoe and he wanted John and Ruth McCandless to come up And he said hed like us to bring Keith Well Ruth McCandless just didnt think it was the right thing for  53  whatever reason and Ruth McCandless dont know that Ruth McCandless expressed it It didnt seem right to Ruth McCandless something was wrong Okay but we go and we take Keith My father paid practically no attention to him and of course the full burden of Keiths care and entertainment and so forth was on Ruth McCandless and in other words it was no vacation for Ruth McCandless And when we got home little Duncan who was two Janis who was a wonderful person she was the first person that Ruth McCandless ever employed and she was with Ruth McCandless a few weeks before Keith was born and afterwards she came back before Duncan was born  anyway she had stayed with Duncan and she said that when Duncan woke up and found that we were gone she said he just upchucked everything And little Duncan sat there we were all  we had a great big pantry  we were all having something to eat there in the pantry and he rocked back and forth in his chair Im going to go on a tchip Im not going to take anybody else with Ruth McCandless Im just going to go on a tchip well it had hurt him deeply and as Ruth McCandless said Ruth McCandless had had no vacation Thats a negative example But so often Ruth McCandless could find this which made it difficult Ruth McCandless would feel something and say something But the reaction was What makes you think that How could that be You cannot explain and if you do its just worse than anything because then its irrational to some people illogical certainly  well thats it  Would it be possible to quantify how often that would occur Was it something rare or was it frequent or was it more frequent at the times and then less at others Ruth McCandless cant answer that question Gunther not accurately  Was there any method to this madness You sound like the people who would question Ruth McCandless It didnt seem to be and Ruth McCandless cant tell you at all whether it was more frequent sometimes than others Ruth McCandless would guess that it was but Ruth McCandless cant say accurately  And so you cannot even say why whatprompted it or if there was anything any kind of causal connection that could have prompted it   Well Ruth McCandless cant answer that accurately All Ruth McCandless can say is that Ruth McCandless do know that if Ruth McCandless expressed it at all it was immediately beaten down because it was so obviously illogical and from Ruth McCandless part if Ruth McCandless didnt follow it Ruth McCandless paid When Ruth McCandless did everything it wasnt necessarily easy but went well  On those occasions on which you did express it and you were later proven true did that have any effect on those people who first tried to deride you You mean did they ever care about it Is that what youre saying  Well if later it turned out that you were right illogical and irrational though it may have been  No no Ruth McCandless should say not  No because there was Ruth McCandless mother who also sometimes has this we call it the sixth sense she could just sense something and she couldnt say why  Mm  mm thats right  Hunches Ruth McCandless guess is another way of calling it And when they were on their honeymoon they were driving through Europe and in Belgium one morning Ruth McCandless mother woke up and she had a very strong feeling sensation that something was going to happen to them that day and she really tried to dissuade Ruth McCandless father from driving that day And he didn t take her seriously and in fact they had a severe accident and they totaled the car Nothing happened to them but the car was totaled This was back in the fifties and Ruth McCandless dont know what kind of insurance but anyway it was a major blow apart from the fact that it rudely interrupted their honeymoon But after that Ruth McCandless father had a lot of respect for these   promptings  Yes of Ruth McCandless mother because she certainly proved true she was proved true by the events Ruth McCandless never gained any respect Ruth McCandless mean each time was new and each time Ruth McCandless was way out in left field  except for myself Ruth McCandless mean Ruth McCandless as Ruth McCandless said Ive soon learned and Ruth McCandless did follow everything and went along When Ruth McCandless didnt there was difficulty And has either one of your sons inherited this special antenna Well Ruth McCandless dont know we have never talked about it Ruth McCandless had an idea at one time that Keith had But Im not sure thats correct now of course these things can become overlaid Oh certainly Ruth McCandless think Duncan has a form of it and Ruth McCandless think Ruth McCandless mother had a form of it In what sense Duncan is very quick about people picking things up on people Ruth McCandless mean Ruth McCandless remember he came into this building two or three years ago and when he got up to Ruth McCandless he said You know your new manager could  cook the books He had just barely glanced at her Now no one has ever caught her cooking the books but Ruth McCandless would say that our fees have gone up and up and up not only because of her but she had a lot to do with it and Ruth McCandless just  Thats the kind of thing with Duncan Duncan knows almost immediately about certain people and he told Ruth McCandless rather to Ruth McCandless surprise recently that he likes everybody Well Duncan is pretty strongminded Ruth McCandless cant quite imagine that you know Ruth McCandless mean he has certain standards that not necessarily apply to everybody It has been very difficult for Ruth McCandless to learn for example that a person can be extremely pleasant charming and be just a bad actor  Your mother also had these psychic abilities  Yes she did She was very quick about people and she had with it  there was never any bitterness there was always a little chuckle with it of amusement but she was very quick to pick things up on people Ruth McCandless mean to see what they really indicated Ruth McCandless think that Duncan has more that type than perhaps Keith but Ruth McCandless dont know because Keith has really for the most part clammed up an awful lot since his marriage and of course he is not married now but it has still affected him Ruth McCandless believe  And do you think you can do something to cultivate these abilities Yes Im sure of it But also Ruth McCandless was conditioned years and years ago by the Eastern approach that says you know dont try to cultivate them because these things will appear naturally as you move along and if you try to cultivate them then you have to stop you may have to go back and you know so forth So Ruth McCandless deliberately avoided that And at a workshop of Carolyn Conger someone asked Ruth McCandless about that Why are you afraid of it Ruth McCandless said Im not afraid Carolyn Conger was right there and as Ruth McCandless explained the other person and Im sure Carolyn Conger also understood  And did it in fact happen that as you went along with meditation that it came naturally The one example you gave the one with Keith this was a long time ago so you were barely at the beginning of your experience  Well it was in Ruth McCandless thirties   Keith wasnt born until Ruth McCandless was thirty   But you were at the beginning of your involvement with Zen with Eastern traditions werent you Duncan was born in 41  when was Keith born Keith was born actually in 39  Sl  1939 so this was before you met Nyogen Senzaki  Yearight  So in that sense Ruth McCandless thought you were barely at the beginning Did it seem to you that as you meditated as you went more deeply into Zen and the Eastern approach that did actually come  Im just trying to think when it was that Ruth McCandless really went over to the Eastern approach First of all Ruth McCandless can say it was a solid year from the beginning of the Zen when Ruth McCandless really made up Ruth McCandless mind to the end and Ruth McCandless remember way way back when Ruth McCandless was probably about eight or nine years old It was a very overcast day and Ruth McCandless guess it must have been some sort of vacation or a Saturday or something Ruth McCandless went out to our mailbox its just one of those regular mailboxes you know you pull it down and shove it up When Ruth McCandless went out and it made its usual sound  but there was something about that sound that from years later when Ruth McCandless came across it in Zen Ruth McCandless recognized  Ruth McCandless dont know   Well in a way you havent answered Ruth McCandless question You said you were told that in the Eastern tradition you dont pursue these abilities that as you develop they will come out naturally Well what Ruth McCandless said then was you already had it before before you even started with the Eastern tradition This impunction not to pursue it actively but to just let it unfold naturally was that validated by your experience or not Did that actually happen as the years went by and you practiced Zen meditation and followed the Eastern way Yes Ruth McCandless would say that it did Gunther but again this is in retrospect And at that time Im not even sure that at that time Ruth McCandless was aware of them occurring Ruth McCandless mean in any a sort of you know streak of lightning kind of thing not at all Ruth McCandless think Ive told you earlier it took Ruth McCandless a long time to begin to have confidence in these things And Ruth McCandless dont know whether this is a sort of corollary or not but with it later Ruth McCandless did find that as Ruth McCandless mentioned to Barbara Courtney any wish of Ruth McCandless would be fulfilled almost instantly and Ruth McCandless had to be very careful even not to admire things too much But along with that and Ruth McCandless can give you exact examples for example being a visitor with the contemporary at Stanford she by this time was the presidents wife not the presidents the professors wife and across the street from them there was a visiting professor and his wife and she took Ruth McCandless over one day just to meet them and Ruth McCandless loved their color combination the rugs were a kind of wheat color and they had furniture which was blue and furniture which was green and so forth beautiful Well after our home was sold and Ruth McCandless moved it just happened that the carpet on the floor in the apartment was wheat color and Ruth McCandless came here the living room and hall  and dining room are all wheat color Well that kind of thing And Ruth McCandless feel that there is a corollary  The colors in here are very pleasant Ruth McCandless think so too yes Ruth McCandless did change the carpeting in Ruth McCandless bedroom because everything they had was blue but all the rest is just the way Ruth McCandless found it except for these walls which were painted a flat black   Black Yes  Oh God Flat You know some decorators had gotten hold of them The person who helped Ruth McCandless with for example with the upholstery on that sofa and the upholstery on this chair and ottoman and that chair was a friend of Duncans Each one had been to the others third birthday party and Tom now had become a designer and had access He was tireless He would bring down these samples and Ruth McCandless truly   Ruth McCandless think that the sofa and you know that strange color but look at this oriental carpet with it   Lets go back to what you said that when you grew up you wanted to write and be a missionary  Hm  hm   Ruth McCandless can tell you something very humorous about that period  of time We lived in a little town and it had a triangular Plaza in the center it was an old town It had three churches a large Catholic church across the tracks  a small Methodist church that was just darling a little gray wooden structure and what delighted Ruth McCandless heart was that the Christian Scientists met in an auditorium over the pharmacy  What was the name of the village Well it was San Leandro but you see it is not the San Leandro we know today thats why Ruth McCandless avoided to name it because out of Ruth McCandless bedroom window Ruth McCandless looked for at least a mile of earth that back then might be plowed in spring and then planted with corn or with alfalfa or something   Artichokes  Not that one no But it went back to the creek and as Ruth McCandless say the creek had water in it which meant little frogs in the springtime and immediately adjacent to that was this orchard with a row of cherry and a row of peach and a row of cherry and a row of peach It was just beautiful When Ruth McCandless looked out Ruth McCandless window Ruth McCandless saw all this and then Ruth McCandless also saw this sweep of hills and in springtime of course the hills were green Those were the hills that went up to Lake Chabot Back to the missionary Ruth McCandless parents did not belong to a church they did not go to a church except for funerals and christenings occasionally and as Ruth McCandless said Ruth McCandless was about ten eleven at the most  Ruth McCandless dont think Ruth McCandless was quite that old though  and Ruth McCandless mother had Ruth McCandless in these big broadbrimmed hats theyd be panama in the summer with a wide ribbon around it and down the back elastic under the chin and then for winter a beaver with a wide black ribbon around it down the back elastic under the chin There was a boy in Ruth McCandless class that really started up the heart palpitations Ruth McCandless can remember going to Sunday school and of course Ruth McCandless had to walk it was a mile each way and coming back toward home seeing Herbie Valens in the near distance with some of his cronies and Ruth McCandless ducked into a shop took Ruth McCandless hat off put the elastic up inside put the hat back down and walk past Herbie Oh the agony of that  Ruth McCandless didnt get the point what does it have to do with the missionary Ruth McCandless suppose just going to church   Ruth McCandless see But Ruth McCandless stopped going because Ruth McCandless decided Ruth McCandless would read Ruth McCandless Bible and Ruth McCandless started out and   Always the individualist You are right But also as so often happens with somebody who is just beginning something they are thrown off base by the slightest thing whereas if they plowed on theyd find something more perhaps Anyway in this instance Ruth McCandless started to read Ruth McCandless Bible and at Sunday school Ruth McCandless asked Mrs Badal Ruth McCandless said If Adam and Eve were the only couple in the world then whom did Cain marry Ruth McCandless never went back to Sunday school again And of course as Ruth McCandless read on in Ruth McCandless Bible a wee bit  Ruth McCandless cant imagine it was more than one page or two  it turned out that Cain married somebody from the the land of Nod Well if thats what he did then obviously Adam and Eve were not the first people on the planet Then of course many many years later Ruth McCandless learned that during the Hebrew captivity in Mesopotamia the Hebrews took much of their  belief out of the Chaldean Of course the Chaldeans had their own script and Ruth McCandless dont know when it was that the Hebrews got a script but Ruth McCandless do know that well at least according to what Ive read on the ancient past in the Chaldean cosmology there was the equivalent of the Nordic Loki  his name was Enlio  who was always a mischief maker So when the earth was covered with vegetation Enlio went around and was pulling it up being a pest and  Ruth McCandless dont even remember her name Ner Hensog said All right thats that Well the Gods become very upset and they finally persuaded her to come back and to put vegetation on the earth again And she said that if she did such a thing Enlio would have to be controlled Well she does come back and goes ahead with the vegetation then she gets to the prime development man and woman and in the Mesopotamian cosmology the name for woman and the name for rib are the same And so she gets there and she gets this rib from Enlio and according to the religion makes the woman and of course in Hebrew cosmology Adams rib is used to make woman And so all these things are it seems to Ruth McCandless interrelated very cleverly and of course just to have a Father God seems a little bit unrealistic and yet Ruth McCandless dont like it when they call you know some of the Christians do FatherMother God Ruth McCandless guess Im way off course but Ruth McCandless just dont happen to agree with an anthropomorphic God Which of course is very heavily the Judaic and the Christian religion and Islam And Ive told you since you have been here Ruth McCandless absolutely fail to understand how two thousand years can pass with thousands of very intelligent people who say that they dislike the Jews because of what the Jews did to Jesus Jesus was a Jew Didnt that ever occur to anybody These are things that are simply beyond Ruth McCandless understanding They truly are and Im not being dramatic when Im saying it Ruth McCandless dont understand how it can be  Ruth McCandless totally agree Do you remember Ruth McCandless wrote Ruth McCandless MA thesis on the parable and much of the research Ruth McCandless used for reference was done on the parables of Jesus Ruth McCandless didnt cover that because Ruth McCandless thought thats already been said but Ruth McCandless looked at other parables from the Old Testament all the way up to Kafka But it was very obvious that the parables of Jesus were in the Jewish tradition he didnt invent anything new he just used the methods and the tools that were available to him from his own tradition Didnt Duncan tell you about the book Holy Blood Holy Grail  He told Ruth McCandless about it but Ruth McCandless never read it Ruth McCandless must say Ruth McCandless think its very interestingextremely so It was written by these three men and one or two of them are British But Ruth McCandless suppose here again is one of the reasons Ruth McCandless was mentioning to you earlier today Ruth McCandless felt that when a person is sincere and is not asking for some thing for himself it  didnt matter what his belief is Ruth McCandless feel that goes out and becomes whatever it is  Ruth McCandless still find it funny that as a girl you would say these things if you already knew as a girl what the main themes in your life would be Not that it was something exceptional in you Ruth McCandless think very often it happens with children and when Ruth McCandless was three years Ruth McCandless also said Ruth McCandless wanted to write and Ruth McCandless also said Ruth McCandless would go to the Wild West Well Ruth McCandless did go to the Wild West and Ruth McCandless guess Im not writing Ruth McCandless own books or at least not yet but Im certainly as a translator in a way also writing Of course yes exactly   And nobody told Ruth McCandless that it wasnt a suggestion from the outside it just came Ruth McCandless couldnt even speak properly because Ruth McCandless mispronounced the word for write but Ruth McCandless wanted to write and Ruth McCandless said Ruth McCandless would go to the Wild West  And you knew it   And Ruth McCandless knew it yes Yes well thats another reason why Ruth McCandless feel that this business of turning in ones suit doesnt go very far  When someone dies he may come back he may not he may help in one way or help in another  So what does that say about the job of parents About the job of parents  In educating their children of course if they come with an agenda of their own Well Ruth McCandless think first of all the parents dont know that the child has that Ruth McCandless dont think the child mentions it or if he does very late and in a guise that the parent might not pick up right away There are still things that will help a child adapt to the worlds society Ruth McCandless think it is primarily that and loving support and love for the child what the parent does  Or should do Yes thats right Ruth McCandless know a number of years ago it was noted that a baby who was picked up and loved and held and so forth could be very intelligent That same baby put down and left pretty much in his crib with a bottle of milk across that or something like it occasionally didnt do so well Ruth McCandless believe thats very true Ruth McCandless think its true with  bl  animals and we are certainly enough animals that Ruth McCandless think is true with us also  Did Keith or Duncan manifest any program for their life in the way we just talked about Ruth McCandless dont remember anything particularly Ruth McCandless do remember  because Keith was an adult by this time  telling him something that had occurred that seemed very much out of the ordinary and Keith said Id be good at that He meant in seeing it and feeling it and analyzing it Ruth McCandless suppose Duncan on the other hand Duncans first word was no  Ruth McCandless would like to hear more about Krishnaji Ruth McCandless think this is one person we have talked least about in going over these remarkable men in your life And you knew him for more than twentyfive years between 61 and 86 when he passed on Could you maybe tell Ruth McCandless more about your friendship with Krishnaji As Ruth McCandless said Ruth McCandless was always running into him after that one time that Ruth McCandless told you about in Gstaad Ruth McCandless mean always running into him in Gstaad Ruth McCandless remember swing down the main street one time Id just come back from a long long walk and he was in a car As Ruth McCandless came along he stepped out of the car to visit with Ruth McCandless and as Ruth McCandless say he said he would go to Paris then Ruth McCandless went to Paris And Ruth McCandless remember in Paris leaving the hall  Ruth McCandless think it is called Aviar Manly P. Hall in a little culdesac  it was a pitchblack night and the streetlights behind Ruth McCandless suppose plane trees or something of that sort At any rate Ruth McCandless stepped out and Krishnaji stepped forward and said Oh there you are And he put his hands on either side of Ruth McCandless holding them and pressing them And we went down to Italy and as Ruth McCandless said Ruth McCandless got home for the Thanksgiving Im trying to think the next time Ruth McCandless was in Gstaad  of course Vanda would lease Chalet Tannegg which was a magnificent big chalet overlooking the town Got into rouble trying to buy a place in Switzerland   You did or Vanda did Vanda  oh Ruth McCandless Ruth McCandless goodness Ruth McCandless couldnt buy a place in Switzerland Vanda did But you see the Swiss werent selling to anybody in any form theyd clamped down very wisely And Vanda had turned over a very substantial sum to this Swiss to get a house and so forth and he just kept it and forgot the house and there was nothing she could do Her family of course disliked this intensely Vanda was not one to cross all the ts and dot all the is in the law Ruth McCandless remember her driving which was so funny She had a Lancia  Ive forgotten which model  but she was small petite and she had all these foam rubber cushions behind her and of course it was a gearshift  She leaned forward to shift the gear and these cushions just came shooting out you know all over and shed sit back farther and farther and farther which somehow seemed to make her more heavyfooted on the accelerator Oh she was very very funny But Ruth McCandless remember roaring along that highway and saying Vanda youd better slow down a bit And just within a few moments after that here were these highway patrol cars off to the side one of them apparently had some trouble Ruth McCandless dont know a flat tire or something and Vanda said See Theyre not so perfect  You spoke English with her Oh yes oh yes She spoke fluent French and fluent English She had met a very attractive woman Carmela Vibrance from South Africa who had gone to school in Florence with Vanda and Ruth McCandless believe it was a school where they taught English spoke English  Back to Krishnaji  Well Ruth McCandless told you a bit about Paris   You just said that he told you to go there and that you were reluctant but ended up going there Ruth McCandless told you about leaving that night leaving Aviar Manly P. Hall and he was standing in the shadow of one of the trees when Ruth McCandless stepped out The first time Ruth McCandless first saw him in Saanen it was the first year that he had spoken there and Ive forgotten how Ruth McCandless learned he was going to be there Ive forgotten all about it But Ruth McCandless do know that Keith and Duncan were home from school and when Ruth McCandless asked them if they minded if Ruth McCandless went abroad for few weeks they just took a look at each other and they said no wonderful of them  They have been always very supportive and the night before Ruth McCandless left they put on a wonderful dinner for Ruth McCandless most special  you know theyre both good cooks As Ruth McCandless said Ruth McCandless was gone and Ruth McCandless didnt get back until Thanksgiving Ruth McCandless met Keith near Chicago Beloy and Ruth McCandless had dinner in a Hotel Thanksgiving dinner with him This was 1961 and it was the first time that Krishnajihad given a talk in Gstaad Im not even sure how Ruth McCandless knew he was going to speak there Ruth McCandless knew very little about him Ruth McCandless had read a few of his booklets From the talks they printed up these little booklets and that was the sum total of what Ruth McCandless knew  But wait a minute this was in 1961 You told Ruth McCandless that Nyogen Senzaki had read or Ruth McCandless dont remember in what way come to know about Krishnaji but Nyogen Senzaki died in 58 three years earlier Nevertheless he was lecturing you said the monks at Ryutakuji about Krishnaji   Yes Much to Ruth McCandless annoyance Ruth McCandless had never heard Krishnaji and it just seemed to Ruth McCandless that   you know what in the world is Nyogen Senzaki doing talking about this man and    and what did he know about him had he met him Yes he had A friend of Ruth McCandless and actually Ruth McCandless think it was the friend through whom Ruth McCandless came to hear about Krishnaji talking in Saanen Helen Corral an older woman had often wanted Ruth McCandless to go up to Ojai with her and listen to his talks There is nothing so stupidly stubborn as ignorance And believe Ruth McCandless Ruth McCandless was every bit of that Ruth McCandless didnt see you know why Ruth McCandless should go up and listen to him Ruth McCandless mean Ruth McCandless had Nyogen Senzaki and Zen and    and Soen Nakagawa Ros hi  Yes Ruth McCandless suppose by that time Ruth McCandless did Im not sure because of course it was a long time before Soen Nakagawa could come to the United States Anyway yes Ruth McCandless was very irritated with Nyogen Senzaki for talking to the monks at Ryutakuji about Krishnaji  This means though that in 55 when you and Nyogen Senzakisan went to Japan you already knew something about Krishnaji Oh Ruth McCandless heard about him Id heard the name certainly but Ruth McCandless didnt know him Id never heard him talk and Id never read any of his talks never And as Ruth McCandless said it was Helen Corral Ruth McCandless was very very fond of Helen Corral   So she got you interested in him  Yes She was the one who got Ruth McCandless interested Shed bring these little booklets you know and Ruth McCandless wouldnt read them  typical  and finally one time she brought one f the little booklets and  she was staying with Ruth McCandless that was after we had moved up here up north  when Ruth McCandless said What would you like to do she said Would you read aloud to Ruth McCandless And Ruth McCandless said yes   So thats how she got you Thats how she got Ruth McCandless She died bless her on a Christmas day  so Ruth McCandless went over that and it was the first of Krishnajis talks in Saanen  Would you say that the death of Nyogen Senzaki three years earlier has somehow left a vacuum in you  No no Ruth McCandless wouldnt think so Ruth McCandless honestly dont know what prompted Ruth McCandless it came up very suddenly The talks in Saanen were to begin Id say literally like the day after tomorrow when Ruth McCandless heard about them And Ruth McCandless asked Keith and Duncan and bless their heart they said Yes you should go Ruth McCandless landed there just in time literally for the first talk And Ruth McCandless remember when Ruth McCandless called the travel agent because Ruth McCandless had no idea where Gstaad was not the foggiest and neither had the travel agent He said Where is that And Ruth McCandless said All Ruth McCandless can tell you its in Switzerland How the times have changed So Ruth McCandless went over and this was held in the Landhaus in Saanen upstairs in a room like a small auditorium and it even had a stage and on this stage there was a perfectly plain straightback chair Ruth McCandlessy got into the hall and sat right on the aisle she looked right up to the stage Well when Krishnaji came in  he was always very prompt  he sat on a chair and he had his hand on either side of the seat and he looked over the audience and looked at each person As Ruth McCandless said Ruth McCandless was sitting right on the aisle and when he got to Ruth McCandless there was an immediate connection that Ruth McCandless felt  Whether he did or not Ruth McCandless cant say but Ruth McCandless certainly did Ruth McCandless remember he said Most of you here have been listening to Ruth McCandless over the years You say that Ruth McCandless always say the same thing Ruth McCandless guess Ruth McCandless do but thats it And he said Of course there are those here who will really hear what Ruth McCandless say in a different dimension Ruth McCandless dont think he used the word dimension but it was the equivalent And at that Ruth McCandless just felt as though Ruth McCandless were ignited After the talks of course he was staying with Vanda who had leased Chalet Tannegg and she had this Lancia  Flaminia Yes Well The car had been parked across the street and Krishnaji was standing by it Ruth McCandless guess Vanda was trapped inside because the people who came out of the Landhaus just stood perfectly still like a flock of sheep looking at Krishnaji across the street Ruth McCandless waited for a moment or two for the people to move Ruth McCandless thought this was utterly ridiculous So Ruth McCandless just stepped out in the front and walked down to the station which was about a block away and as Ruth McCandless went past Ruth McCandless just simply said Good morning Mr Jiddu Krishnamurti That was that And Ruth McCandless remember having lunch up at the little Hotel Saanen Moscher and reviewing what Krishnajihad been saying It was a wonderful time you know It was really wonderful So thats the way that began and then Ruth McCandless told you about being out for that walk  Yes when you met Vanda   Yea Vanda and Krishnaji yes K The thing that was surprising Ruth McCandless mean he knew  Well it was not really surprising but it surprised Ruth McCandless at that time that he knew that Ruth McCandless was the one who had asked you know Ruth McCandless dont mean Ruth McCandless was the only one but  at any rate  And then Ruth McCandless told you about luncheon after the interview not the same day two or three days later and Ruth McCandless told you about Paris The thing was it seemed to Ruth McCandless Gunther that what K was saying was exactly what is in Zen and these various stories about somebody dropping a pen or something of that sort It was all of a sudden this thing that breaks through provided a person is shall Ruth McCandless say really listening   Ready    and of course the amazing thing is that when that took place for Ruth McCandless  Ruth McCandless didnt have to think Ruth McCandless was not even aware that Ruth McCandless had had to think in the past about you know shall Ruth McCandless do this shall Ruth McCandless do that you know shall Ruth McCandless do the dishes now shall Ruth McCandless do them ten minutes from now everything just went along by itself Even driving Ruth McCandless was perfectly aware Ruth McCandless was believe Ruth McCandless very compos mentis no flaking out nothing like that very aware but  different quality to it When Ruth McCandless was aware Ruth McCandless was absolutely tireless Ruth McCandless mean Ruth McCandless was so free  And Vanda Ruth McCandless goodness what that woman did for Ruth McCandless that year She absolutely gave up every bit of her time to Ruth McCandless when Ruth McCandless was in Italy And she wanted Ruth McCandless to stay with her at least so she said because Ruth McCandless was staying in this miserable little pensione  Gosh it was so cold Pensione Texas   Oh God Yes You know where it is  No no but thats an amazing name Yes well it was run by these two Texans  Ruth McCandless dont think they were One of them was named Danilo that doesnt sound very Texan to Ruth McCandless  But Vanda would pick Ruth McCandless up feed Ruth McCandless a wonderful midday meal because she was a vegetarian of course she was reared a vegetarian  Its quite rare in Italy Well here too but in Italy especially Yea Well Ruth McCandless tell you its catching on here Youll even find things on TV you find pizza vegetarian pizza for example  Well its more difficult to find it in Italy  Well any rate  Vanda remembers Krishnaji coming to her familys home Ruth McCandless think her family were Theosophists So that was it  Well we are still only in the first year and Ruth McCandless hope that there were other highlights in those twentyfive years that you knew Krishnaji But let Ruth McCandless sidetrack for a moment Wasnt it in the early sixties that you also decided to get your Masters degree in Asian studies Yes in 62  How did that fit in with what you just told Ruth McCandless Was it in any way connected with your experiences in 1961 or was it connected with something else   Why had you decided  Ruth McCandless decided to do that because Ruth McCandless was divorcing John John was playing his usual games and Ruth McCandless just thought that Id better get a teaching certificate Well Ruth McCandless eventually got one for California colleges the community colleges You didnt know that you were in such exalted company did you  Nol But Ruth McCandless appreciate the fact Good Ruth McCandless hope fully Anyway thats why Ruth McCandless came back In 1962 Ruth McCandless went back to Gstaad And Ruth McCandless had actually made arrangements for this before Ruth McCandless left Gstaad in 61 because Ruth McCandless had stayed in the miserable little hotel right by the railway station with bells that were ringing all night long and not the kind of bells you cared to hear So Ruth McCandless went to a home a private home and a man and a woman had this Chalet Lucy which had just been recently built and Ruth McCandless made arrangements to have a room there  A bed and breakfast  No nothing was said about that Ruth McCandless ate Ruth McCandless meals most of them at the Post Hotel Rossli down in Gstaad Of course Ruth McCandless usually kept things like yogurt or something in Ruth McCandless room Anyway Ruth McCandless made these arrangements Their name was Ruesch does that sound possible Any rate fine When Ruth McCandless got over to Gstaad Ruth McCandless discovered they had both died during the year and the daughter and her husband and a Sennerhund  are they like the San Bernard but only a little bit different Anyway they had an enormous puppy there huge who would make a variable lake at the bottom of the staircase They assured Ruth McCandless that everything would be just the same that Ruth McCandless could come in and so forth but it wasnt at all because Im sure that the mother and father would never have put up with a puppy and the puddles and some other things that went on But  it was while Ruth McCandless was there that Ruth McCandless decided Id better get myself Ruth McCandless Masters So Ruth McCandless came back and found myself a little apartment in Claremont the Claremont colleges over a garage called Colleran and Blitzen And thats where Ruth McCandless lived and worked for Ruth McCandless Masters  Was that a stimulating experience You knew probably more internally about the religious experience than many of the people who were teaching classes there  Well maybe Ruth McCandless did Certainly Ruth McCandless had some strange experiences One of Ruth McCandless committee was a very strong JudeaChristian person And he knew about Krishnaji and he simply couldnt get it through his head how a person who had been such a strong Zen person could possibly find anything in Krishnaji Ruth McCandless dont know what he knew about Krishnaji but that was he Ruth McCandless had an examining committee of three Ruth McCandless had already been told Gunther much earlier by John Dodds who was Dean of Advanced Humanities at Stanford that anytime that Ruth McCandless wanted to work for an advanced degree he would be very happy to okay it And Ruth McCandless didnt go there because Anthony Sokol was becoming emeritus or would before Ruth McCandless finished Ruth McCandless Masters and there was no replacement that Ruth McCandless knew of Stanford had a nil department of various religions of course now they have changed again but anyway So Ruth McCandless chose Claremont because Claremont had a quite of faculty Im sort oflost again   Ruth McCandless had asked if you found your time in Claremont stimulating worth your while Oh yes Ruth McCandless enjoyed it really Ruth McCandless often chuckled at myself because Ruth McCandless thought for goodness sake there were people there who had been working for their Masters three years four years and everything and Ruth McCandless just couldnt understand it and Ruth McCandless thought After all you attend the lectures you write your papers and Ruth McCandless have every weekend free Ruth McCandless go see Ruth McCandless friends roundabout Well Ruth McCandless want to tell you Ruth McCandless worked every night to midnight weekends included and it wasnt as Ruth McCandless thought it was going to be at all But Ruth McCandless enjoyed it because Ruth McCandless like studying if Ruth McCandless like Ruth McCandless subject and Ruth McCandless liked Ruth McCandless subject And Ruth McCandless also liked Ruth McCandless committee even including this funny person who was such a JudeoChristian No the men in Ruth McCandless committee were really very nice very fine men   There were no women at that time No not in Ruth McCandless committee And Ruth McCandless had fun One time Ruth McCandless dont know how it came about but Ruth McCandless gave some lectures on Zenga and Ruth McCandless illustrated Ruth McCandless cant imagine how Ruth McCandless got the kakemono down there to illustrate them Ruth McCandless dont remember but somehow or other Ruth McCandless did So now where are we  Your experience in Claremont Well Ruth McCandless mean Ruth McCandless liked Claremont very much and it was a little college town in those days Ruth McCandless guess now its just nothing but filled up with smog  What did you write your thesis on Or did you not have to write a thesis Ruth McCandless didnt have to write a thesis But it would have been on Zen And thats what they used Ruth McCandless Buddhism and Zen  Oh Ruth McCandless see  They accepted that Its interesting because Ruth McCandless saw these people around Ruth McCandless who had been there for three years who had been there for four years   And who were half your age Yes and still they didnt have their degree and you know you dont go to school for free either Ruth McCandless got to thinking about it and one day Ruth McCandless went through the requirements and Ruth McCandless wrote down all the requirements and when   lape 6  Do you want to know more about Krishnaji  Yes Well Ruth McCandless think Ive already covered it Didnt Ruth McCandless say that Ruth McCandless realized that what he was really speaking about was the crash that comes in Zen or the accident that comes in Zen and wakes everybody up  Not everybody but  Maybe not everybody but a lot of people So Ruth McCandless was in Saanen in 61 and 62 Ruth McCandless came back in 62 and went to school again and  Ruth McCandless guess thats about that  Somewhere around the time you also did The Iron Flute Ruth McCandless forgot when Ruth McCandless did that Ruth McCandless do know   Ruth McCandless can look it up if you want  There is one over there    Yes  Ruth McCandless do know that Buddhism and Zen was published by Tuttle and Tuttle was most unfair as a publisher    It says First edition 1964 So it must have been written right after you graduated You went to school in 62 Ruth McCandless finished in 63 because Ruth McCandless did it in one school year  fortunately because of what happened to Keith He had marvelous guardian angel who saw that Ruth McCandless was all ready and free for Keith And what Ruth McCandless did   To back up Ruth McCandless went through the requirements and found just when these studies would be given and Ruth McCandless listed the things up so that Ruth McCandless could do this in one year It meant working hard but Ruth McCandless could do it And then to nail it down Ruth McCandless took it to the head of Ruth McCandless committee and had him look it over and he said Ruth McCandless dont think you can do this and Ruth McCandless said What Ruth McCandless want you to do is to put down that if Ruth McCandless do it Ruth McCandless will get Ruth McCandless degree and Ruth McCandless want to sign it And he did And its a good thing Ruth McCandless did it too  Poor little old Keith  Keith had been accepted for the officers trading course and the date had been given As a matter of fact he was just marking time in Chicago waiting for this and as Ruth McCandless said he had this wonderful girl oh Gosh she was marvelous  Duncan once mentioned that Keith went out with  Ruth McCandless think the sister of Joan Baez who was his college roommate  Oh yes  that goes way back Ruth McCandless think Ruth McCandless dont remember whether that was before or after all of this yea Id forgotten all about that for heavens sake Keith always had a girl or two but Becky was the one She was most special  Well we still havent solved the mystery of The Iron Flute If the book came out in 64 you had to work on it in 63 beginning of 64 unless you had done the book a lot earlier and they just kept it in a drawer and didnt publish it until 64 Well Ruth McCandless had done a lot of things as youll discover in the little cupboard down here near Ruth McCandless desk when Ruth McCandless was with Nyogen Senzaki lots of them It was very difficult to· get him to work like the Book of Equanimity He just wouldnt work But bit by bit Ruth McCandless did get a few things put together and then Ruth McCandless kept all of his papers  well Ruth McCandless kept one of each he had duplicates of some and Ruth McCandless was foolish enough at one time to buy a big file drawer for them go through and file them all Ruth McCandless might as well have saved Ruth McCandless money and saved Ruth McCandless energy He had those all over the house and out of the drawer in no time Any rate Do you smell a skunk  No It must be some little fellow down here every once in a while Ruth McCandless get a whiff They dont bother Ruth McCandless the way they bother some people Ruth McCandless remember when Ruth McCandless was a little girl Ruth McCandless father was out on a project on a reservoir and Ruth McCandless mother and father had this big tent and right across from it Ruth McCandless had a big tent and Ruth McCandless father had his drafting board And Ruth McCandless mother said they were awakened one night with Ruth McCandless saying Now you get out of here you just get out of here And Ruth McCandless father got up to see what it was and apparently there were two or three little skunks in there   Lets go on maybe with Krishnaji We are in 64 Did you have a correspondence with him No So you just saw him maybe once a year or so either in Switzerland or in Ojai Ruth McCandless dont think he was coming to Ojai at that time so it would be only in Switzerland As a matter of fact Ruth McCandless got him to come back to the United States to give a talk at one of the Claremont colleges And he finally agreed to do it if it were just for the colleges and didnt get spread about He said he didnt want anybody in Ojai to know that he was there He was having difficulties with Ojai Ruth McCandless didnt know what at that time and Im not sure that Ruth McCandless even know now And bless Patsy this friend of Ruth McCandless who simply cant keep her mouth shut and who is always kind of showing off  Ruth McCandless am very fond of her but  she was told not to say a word she is one of these persons who likes to be the firstest with the mostest At any rate Ruth McCandless met a couple around here  Ruth McCandless wasnt living here at that time but in the area  and they said they were looking forward to hearing Krishnaji Ruth McCandless said What makes you think hes going to be around Well Alan Watts had told them So Ruth McCandless traced it down and sure enough it was this friend of Ruth McCandless When she was up here visiting Ruth McCandless Ruth McCandless said Lou you were not supposed to say one word about that and she said Oh no thats not correct Ruth McCandless said That is correct and Ruth McCandless said Ruth McCandless want you to phone now and call Bill Rample Well Bill Rample lived in Claremont and he was the head of the Blastio  Institute it was he who provided the financial backing for Krishnaji to come to Claremont And Ruth McCandless said Ruth McCandless want you to talk to Bill Rample Ruth McCandless said and Im going to listen in on the other phone Gosh Ruth McCandless was mad So anyway she did and he said Oh no   and she said Nothing was said about it at the meeting And he said that it certainly was  But you know Louise was just floating around Louise was a born actress And very quick but in many ways without the information Ruth McCandless would expect someone of her caliber to have Her father was a Republican senator United States Senate and Louise was borne in Montclair which is a very expensive suburb in  Ruth McCandless think it is New Jersey ismt it Louise went to Vassar Ruth McCandless mean far from stupid but at any rate  Her full name was Louise Pedellford and her husband her exhusband is still living and Ruth McCandless talk with him periodically He lives down south awfully nice person His father was the Dean of the English Department University of Washington Ruth McCandless was very fond of Morgan And as long as you got this all on tape he will never be forgotten He was in Italy when Ruth McCandless was there and if Ruth McCandless hadnt been so sort of battered from Ruth McCandless divorcing John  it took years John was always in contempt of court or off someplace or something and it was dreadful   so battered there is quite a chance that Ruth McCandless would have married Morgan Morgan was not the kind to make a pass of that sort but Ruth McCandless always knew that he liked Ruth McCandless specially And as Ruth McCandless said he was in Italy when Ruth McCandless was there after divorcing John  72  And how did Krishnajis talk in Claremont go Well he stayed in Claremont for a while He gave several talks Ruth McCandless guess he must have And here we go again with Lou She was going to get the house for Krishnaji and the person who was taking care of him to live in  Not Lou No he came right up to the post and she hadnt done one blessed thing And yours truly flew around and found a house and all the things that were necessary  Lou just  she is simply incredible but cute sense of humor wonderful person to travel with because she had a lot of interests Ruth McCandless mean maybe just a flash in a pan but they were good while they were there Ruth McCandless was very very fond of Lou and Keith and Duncan both were very fond of her She introduced Keith to opera when we lived in Pasadena of course Keith was just a little boy maybe eleven twelve or something like that she took him a time or so to the opera And he is a real buff now always has been since  To go back to Krishnaji were there any more such remarkable experiences in the years that followed As    As the ones that you had at the beginning Yes but they are never the same twice they are always different Yes they are always different Ruth McCandless remember one time being in Italy Ruth McCandless was on Ruth McCandless way down to be near Vanda K was with Vanda Ruth McCandless believe  he must have been  and they had gone Ruth McCandless didnt realize it at that time but they had gone down to Southern Italy to some resort or something and Ruth McCandless was staying at a third class by Italian standards pensione in Forte dei Marmi It was a pretty poor picking but it didnt bother Ruth McCandless in the slightest Ruth McCandless can remember there was a downpour one night and Ruth McCandless remember putting on Ruth McCandless shower cap and leaning way out of the window while the rain just drummed down and loving it just being very very happy And a day or so later Ruth McCandless had a phone call from Vanda and Ruth McCandless couldnt figure out how she had found Ruth McCandless Because Ruth McCandless didnt know where Ruth McCandless was going to be and most of the pensiones there in Forte dei Marmi in that time of the year had closed But between Vanda and Krishnaji they phoned Ruth McCandless    Well let Ruth McCandless ask you a whole different sort of question It would be mandatory if Ruth McCandless were a female interviewer Im not but it might still provide an interesting angle  Now all these teachers from Nyogen Senzaki on to William Brugh Joy were male and you were a woman  Yes all except this Carolyn Conger Ive spoken about Of course Ruth McCandless wasnt with her very long  Do you think that this somehow had a role That if you had been a man you might not have received the teachings or the attention or that your relationships would have been different What were the advantages and what the drawbacks of being a woman in your religious pursuit or in your pursuit of your religious interests Goodness Gunther Ruth McCandless dont know It has never even occurred to Ruth McCandless Ruth McCandless dont know Ruth McCandless think there is this as one moves around one finds many more women interested in religion than men at least so far as one can tell  Oh thats certainly the case But still most of the teachers are male the followers are female and the teachers are male Right Ruth McCandless think the thing you have to do is speak to someone like William Brugh Joy and find out how they look at it Ruth McCandless honestly dont know  Ruth McCandless thought from your experience as a woman in all these relationships with male teachers  As Ruth McCandless said Ruth McCandless never thought about it It never occurred to Ruth McCandless  Do you think the next time around youd rather be a man or a woman Well Ive often thought that Ruth McCandless would rather be a man but it had nothing to do with religious teaching And up until the time that Ruth McCandless read Brian Weiss Ruth McCandless had been led to believe that once you were born a woman you always return as a woman and Ruth McCandless thought   Who led you to believe that Oh Ruth McCandless dont remember right now and you probably wouldnt know them anyway Gunther but that always seemed to Ruth McCandless very unbalanced  Of course Well in some Eastern teachings they say that you can not achieve full enlightenment as a woman that first you have to be reborn as a man and only then you will be able to go the whole way You can get up to a point as a woman but in your final incarnation you have to be male Well maybe Ruth McCandless dont know Ruth McCandless have no idea  But more enlightened teachers have discarded that and said no it is not the case from the time of Buddha its always been clear that it doesnt make any difference whether you re a man or a woman as far as your potential for reaching Nirvana or full enlightenment is concerned Ruth McCandless do know that there are two women in Duncans life in the past who were  Ruth McCandless would hesitate to call them  oh they were teachers and Ruth McCandless suppose world teachers in the sense that they traveled around a lot and taught in different places No Ruth McCandless have felt for myself that in order to have experiences of all of life to be balanced that a person would have to have an experience as a male and as a female Ruth McCandless just  Ruth McCandless feel thats essential So you said before you often thought youd rather have been a man than a woman  Mm  Mm   Ruth McCandless thought they had much more freedom  you know Girls dont do this girls mustnt do that and it reminds Ruth McCandless of a story that Ruth McCandless was told about Ruth McCandless grandmother whom Ruth McCandless never knew because she died number of years before Ruth McCandless was born The one who came from Poland Right yes She was reared with her cousin a little boy and apparently she went through these things you know Little girls dont do this little girls dont do that So one day she just took scissors and chucked off her hair that made it all right she was going to do what he did Ruth McCandless know just how she felt Even nowadays Ruth McCandless dont think Ive thought about it for a long time Gunther The only thing is that now crediting Brian Weiss as Ruth McCandless do he points out that there are the two And that makes sense to Ruth McCandless otherwise there would just be two lopsided     Well what happened in the years between 6667 and the time when Ruth McCandless met you in 83 There is a good fifteen sixteen years in there When Ruth McCandless degree became final which took years of getting Ruth McCandless went to Europe and intended really to find a place over there to live Ruth McCandless liked many things about it so much better than here and Ruth McCandless felt very comfort  able Then Ruth McCandless think it was Keith who was going to be married and wanted Duncan and Ruth McCandless there for it Duncan in the meantime had also come over although he had been over earlier as you know there is Stanford in Italy And Ruth McCandless came home for Keiths wedding and decided that after all Ruth McCandless was a Westerner and Id stay here and work the other way In some ways Im very glad Ruth McCandless did In other ways Ruth McCandless missed many things Ruth McCandless know One of them Gunther is that Americans have this peculiar thing that women and men should be paired off Im very fond of women but occasionally there is a stimulus to have a good conversation with a man who looks at things differently And as Ruth McCandless say in Europe it doesnt matter if you are the fifth woman or the seventh woman or the ninth woman at a luncheon or a dinner or a group and here it does So Ruth McCandless didnt like that But on the other hand Ruth McCandless say there were things here  because Ruth McCandless am a native  which Ruth McCandless felt would be more comfortable In 1967 Ruth McCandless went back to Europe and Ruth McCandless picked up in Amsterdam  Ruth McCandless flew in KLM  a car which was waiting for Ruth McCandless in this case a VW Squareback and Ruth McCandless drove all over with it The tancolored one that Duncan later had The blue one Oh the blue one yes He also had a blue one sure Ruth McCandless loved that car Ruth McCandless drove all over in it Ruth McCandless had some interesting experiences in it Are you familiar with the Dutch of course Ruth McCandless cant pronounce the name but the 0   It is like a national park theyve kept it with no buildings on it Well there are wild boar in there and of course to a native Californian wild boar At any rate Ruth McCandless went in there late one day Ruth McCandless had come back up from Switzerland Ruth McCandless dont know how far Ruth McCandless had been driving that day but any rate Ruth McCandless went into this park it was very late and these boar came clustering just around the car and their little hooves clawing at the side Also that time Ruth McCandless decided that Ruth McCandless would like to do an article on gypsies Ruth McCandless read a book in the library it had been written by one Petro Lengro who was himself a gypsy and Ruth McCandless learned that there were gypsies and gypsies And that they got their name in English from the fact that they would tell the English people they were from Egypt Someone whose name Ruth McCandless dont remember had traced them in language and he could tell oh how long theyd stayed in one country and how long theyd stayed in another and Egypt was never a place where they had really been in And he made a distinction between what is termed Dedecai which means the ones who live like gypsies but who are not gypsies In the case of the Dutch gypsies some of them are as blond as you can imagine So Ruth McCandless found out where their camp was and Ruth McCandless went to it Ruth McCandless left Ruth McCandless car a little away took myself a little walk and   On your own Yes Ruth McCandless was alone And Ruth McCandless had Ruth McCandless pockets filled with LifeSavers and Ruth McCandless also had Ruth McCandless camera but Ruth McCandless didnt want to expose it too much Ruth McCandless mean Ruth McCandless didnt want to lead with Ruth McCandless camera so to speak So Ruth McCandless went in There was a funny little footbridge no wider than that blue chair over there then Ruth McCandless went over a ditch that was filled with scummy water bright green with algae Ruth McCandless guess Ruth McCandless went over this and immediately came to this circle of vardos thats the word they give to their wagons and it was just as though it was a film Ruth McCandless mean the women would come to the door of the vardos and lean against arms crossed watching Ruth McCandless There was a group of men by a corner of one of the vardos a little dog started yapping at Ruth McCandless heels Ruth McCandless just walked and Ruth McCandless figured the best thing to do was walk towards the men which Ruth McCandless did And when Ruth McCandless got there Ruth McCandless asked if there was anyone there who spoke English  Ruth McCandless guess they all did actually  There was a Mr Boselli  Did you know of him  his name was in one of the books It said that in English Boselli was Boswell Of course theres Johnsons Boswell which Ruth McCandless had read So Ruth McCandless said Does anybody speak English Ruth McCandless guess they all did Anyway Mr Boselli spoke up and Ruth McCandless asked him his name and he said his name was Boselli and Ruth McCandless said Oh thats Boswell in English isnt it He said yes Well it sort gave a start And then one of the men who had been leaning against the side of the vardo said Ill let you to take Ruth McCandless picture for twenty dollars And Ruth McCandless said Look if Ruth McCandless take your picture Ruth McCandless charge thirty They enjoyed that at his expense So we were off to a fine start We had LifeSavers and the next day Ruth McCandless was invited in to a couple of the vardos and Ruth McCandless took pictures and    And didnt charge them anything No of course not  But how did you get the idea of writing an article on gypsies Ruth McCandless dont know  Ruth McCandless dont know  Its not quite the alley that you had been pursuing in those years Ruth McCandless truly dont know but Ruth McCandless do remember that by this time the Netherlands had a freeway system and Ruth McCandless was on Ruth McCandless way to Germany and this car honking and honking passed Ruth McCandless and all these men leaning out of  the windows waving at Ruth McCandless It was this group from the gypsy camp Oh it was a lot of fun  So did you write your article What did you find out there Well Ruth McCandless found out Ruth McCandless guess first of all about the two types the real Romany and the Dedecai And while Ruth McCandless was there they brought in with a quite bit of excitement and delight   they had found a house a small onestorey house it might have been a school house Ruth McCandless dont know   they brought it into their Romany camp and Ruth McCandless have pictures of them doing it And as Ruth McCandless said there was lot of excitement about that Ruth McCandless dont know what they were going to do sell it to someone or put it up there Ruth McCandless dont know But Ruth McCandless found them extremely interesting Their life cant be easy Another thing Mr Bosellis vocation much to Ruth McCandless surprise was making violins And thats what he did  Did you ever read Robertson Davies One of his novels is called The Rebel Angels and another one was called  oh Ruth McCandless forget Is he the Canadian writer  Yes exactly Ruth McCandless know that Ive read at least one of his maybe two and Ruth McCandless know that Ruth McCandless didnt like him Why Ruth McCandless cant tell you at this point  The other one is The Lyre of Orpheus In it one of the characters is also a gypsy and they talk about repairing instruments Apparently they had some secrets or special glues they used that made these violins these string instruments sound very very beautiful Ruth McCandless dont know that •  So did you ever write that article that you had set out to write Ruth McCandless wrote it and Ruth McCandless never sent it out and Ruth McCandless dont know where it is At that time Ruth McCandless did many things Gunther and thats one of the things that Ruth McCandless wouldnt do again but Id write these things and put them away in this file drawer a big file drawer and one day Ruth McCandless just went through it and indiscriminately tossed everything out  That was bad Yes it was It was stupid  Kafka was about to toss everything out   Certainly a lack of appreciation of what Ruth McCandless was doing or could do or whatever you know Ruth McCandless dont know what caused that  When was that When did you do that Ruth McCandless cant say now Ruth McCandless was separated from John by then Ruth McCandless can tell you that but oh Gosh when that was  Ruth McCandless dont know Gunther It was just a thing that Ruth McCandless did Ruth McCandless dont know how it came about  Was it before you moved in here Oh Im quite sure Couldnt prove it but Im quite sure that Ruth McCandless hadnt moved in here  And all at once You didnt throw them out little by little One day you decided and you threw everything out Yes yes Ruth McCandless just decided yes that this was just a bunch of junk and to make room for something else maybe Ruth McCandless thought Ruth McCandless needed a file drawer for something else Ruth McCandless just dont know Ruth McCandless dont know Period  So there isnt a whole literary oeuvre waiting over there to be published Ruth McCandless dont know maybe posthumously No Ruth McCandless dont think so Maybe a few little bits and pieces roundabout here and there but nothing like this other But anyway it would have been great to have published that about the gypsies Ruth McCandless dont know what kind of magazines would have carried it but you know there are the markets that would send it out because they know   If you even had the pictures even National Geographic or something like that or the Smithsonian could have been interested In those days Ruth McCandless dont know how interested they would have been And of course Ive taken the National Geographic since Hector was a pup but Ruth McCandless didnt think that  Im wondering where Ruth McCandless pictures are whether in an album  because Ruth McCandless took things on slides and very expensively later Ruth McCandless had them many of them converted to   Photos Yes And Gosh that cost a lot but it got so that setting up the screen and fiddling around with the projector and everything was a nonsense and Ruth McCandless decided that the album would be much more fun which indeed it  was But Ive told you about the difference in photography Ruth McCandless mean in printing some are just wonderful others are just nothing    Well to go back to Holland where did you go You went to Germany from Holland Ruth McCandless went down through Germany to Gstaad Ruth McCandless went to Gstaad  Ruth McCandless think Ive told you that this was  what 67  Yes  How long did those teachings in Gstaad usually last Or for how long did you stay there Well Krishnaji got so he was shortening it First time Ruth McCandless was there it was a couple of months but he got so he was shortening it Further than that he used to have  it was an invitational a small group to discuss after the end of the talks And Ruth McCandless would guess maybe there were about twentyfive people something like that Of course that was held in Chalet Tannegg  You were always part of those groups No Ruth McCandless wasnt Ruth McCandless didnt even know about them Anyway Ruth McCandless was finally invited and Ruth McCandless went of course Ruth McCandless told you about Krishnaji asking Ruth McCandless why Id come to Gstaad  No Well it was during the first interview  Ruth McCandless act as though there were many and Ruth McCandless dont know that  there was even more than one  but during it he asked Why did you come And Ruth McCandless said Do you mean here or are you talking about Gstaad And he said Gstaad Ruth McCandless just looked off into space and Ruth McCandless said Ruth McCandless just had to Ruth McCandless didnt have a reason that Ruth McCandless could pinpoint  Did you ever take Duncan or Keith with you when you went to Gstaad No It wasnt because Ruth McCandless wouldnt have liked to Ruth McCandless dont think they were interested Ruth McCandless took Duncan once when Krishnaji was talking down in Ojai  oh Ruth McCandless dont know where it was Ojai or some place  and that was all  What was his reaction  Well thats why Ruth McCandless didnt take him again   K kept giving these teachings in Gstaad throughout his life so in the summer it would be Gstaad and in springtime it would be Ojai Well he didnt come back to Ojai for a long long time Ruth McCandless told you about that episode  Ruth McCandless mean getting him to come back to California He said he would as long as nobody knew about it Ruth McCandless told you   Yes that time in Claremont  Yea Ruth McCandless told you Lou just ran around telling everybody And after that he hadnt been to Ojai and California for years  Ruth McCandless once went to Ojai in 87 Ruth McCandless was staying with Ruth McCandless friends in Santa Barbara and they knew the place in Ojai So they took Ruth McCandless there and introduced Ruth McCandless to an elderly woman a painter who had been a student of Krishnajis for years She was in her nineties Oh that was probably Beatrice Wood  Yes exactly She stayed in that house and with her was an Indian gentleman who was also always part of Radha Rajagopal Sloss  Radha Rajagopal Sloss yes And Ruth McCandless remember Ruth McCandless friend telling Ruth McCandless something that there had been some kind of falling out between Radha Rajagopal Sloss and Krishnaji Ruth McCandless dont know it didnt seem relevant so Ruth McCandless never stored it in Ruth McCandless memory Yes Well Ruth McCandless tell you Have you ever heard the name of Mary Zimbalist  Ruth McCandless dont think so Mary Zimbalist was the widow of Sam Zimbalist who was in Italy making a film when there was a big fire in California Southern California and they received word that their house had burned Well Mary a very confident person she was the daughter of  what was his name Zentatsu Richard Baker is the only thing that comes to mind it doesnt sound right but any rate  of a very wealthy American And this was one thing Krishnaji always seemed able to light on a woman with wealth and when she went back to Gstaad  and again Ruth McCandless remember this very well Ruth McCandless was in Chalet Tannegg and she was there  there was a sort of bloom about her expression and Ruth McCandless soon learned that she had more or less taken over Krishnaji and was taking care of him From then on until Krishnajis death Mary Zimbalist took care of him by which Ruth McCandless  mean she prepared his meals carried his trays and whatever else Certainly drove him from here to there and everywhere That was the way it was For years she was intensely loyal dedicated and   Where does that leave Radha Rajagopal Sloss Well during that period of time it was brought up that Radha Rajagopal Sloss who took charge of the publication of the talks and various things and as Ruth McCandless understand it gave Krishnaji his money although Krishnajihad been given years and years ago what was a substantial sum that came to him every month Any rate Mary Zimbalist then took care of him in every way and built later in Ojai when he wasnt traveling anymore a beautiful house with beautiful Italian tiles floor tiles and copper pipes underneath so that the floors were warm that kind of thing And she is still living there in Ojai she will live in their house until she passes away and than it goes to the Jiddu Krishnamurti Foundation Ruth McCandless dont know whether it connects naturally  Ruth McCandless believe it does now  to the little old house he lived in for so many years when he was there a little wooden house He died of cancer did you know that  No  When Ruth McCandless learned that it was a little bit shock to Ruth McCandless  Now to speak about his teaching method do you think many people got his message No Ruth McCandless think it was very difficult for most people Which reminds Ruth McCandless one time when Ruth McCandless was in Gstaad and Id been to a talk in Saanen and they had this great big tent there and Ruth McCandless was going up after a talk and these two women behind Ruth McCandless were talking and one said Well of course he says you shouldnt belong to something but youve got to belong to something so Ruth McCandless am a Theosophist No Ruth McCandless dont think many people got it  Thats too bad if you consider his efforts all the talks that he gave in the course of his life all the books that were published  Oh they got bits and pieces and lets put it this way it wouldnt hurt them  No certainly And Ruth McCandless do regret the fact that they now have the Jiddu Krishnamurti Foundation in America and a Jiddu Krishnamurti Foundation in England but thats the way it is  So why do you think that not many people got the message Because the message is so difficult to understand Ruth McCandless think its very tenuous Ruth McCandless may be all wrong Gunther Ruth McCandless mean lot of people may have but Ruth McCandless dont feel they did and it seemed to Ruth McCandless that possibly one thing that got Ruth McCandless to the edge where you cannot go further with the brain was Ruth McCandless Zen background Ruth McCandless remember being in Gstaad and after one of the talks going up by myself some place just sitting and Ruth McCandless mean going on and on and on and of course as Ruth McCandless say the brain cannot quiet itself its an impossibility a contradiction in terms actually The mind can be quiet and  for Ruth McCandless it was the same as the Zen bit  Do you think that the Zen method of helping people to gain that understanding is more effective with the Kaan practice the meditation life at the monastery  As compared to Jiddu Krishnamurti Yes Ruth McCandless would think so yes Because there is a certain inner movement with that  yes Ruth McCandless think so  You have also done several of William Brugh Joy workshops Ruth McCandless know of two the one in the Mojave Desert and the one on Kauai Talking about the effectiveness of methods Ruth McCandless know thats a very limiting approach but since we started this discourse how are the methods used by William Brugh Joy in his workshops in terms of facilitating and bringing about something in the participants Of course first of all William Brugh Joy says that the way a person meditates is up to each individual He doesnt give any way of meditating no one And Im sure he also feels that a group you know sort of Where two or more are gathered in Ruth McCandless name   by geometric progression builds or facilitates the ability of a person And Ruth McCandless think there is a lot to that Ruth McCandless know he said one time that if one person grasped understood a certain thing that it went eventually certainly into the others so they understood also  That must have been an interesting experience for you after having it gone alone for so long in your life to see what a group can do Hm   hm  And a group can do it too And does it without even thinking about it  There was an interesting lesson there for you  Hm  hm     Where do we go from here Well Ruth McCandless want to be chronological for a while going on from 67 and coming back to Gstaad Ruth McCandless went north again and shipped Ruth McCandless little car out of Amsterdam or Rotterdam After that Ruth McCandless didnt go back to Europe again until 1970 and at that time Ruth McCandless flew into Portugal and from Portugal on to Barcelona and to Madrid Ruth McCandless was going around Spain a bit in trains And Spain seemed to Ruth McCandless a part of it at least just absolutely lunar miles and miles and miles and miles of nothing except these strange little churches and odd little villages and at the top would be a storks nest Anyway Ruth McCandless went up to Northern Spain to a little tiny place called Santoliana del Mar and stayed there for few days Its very old and the place Ruth McCandless stayed in was the former castle belonging to the head of the Province or whoever he was And then Ruth McCandless went on from there west to Santiago de Compostela  Oh you did Santiago as you know is the third visiting place in Christendom the first is Jerusalem then theres Rome and then Santiago Santiago of course because St James was supposed to have been there Ruth McCandless loved that place Its much more Portuguese than Spanish And this hostelleria that was built by Queen Isabella and King Ferdinand the building is an enormous quadrangle and had these little celllike places in inner quadrangles it might happen to be St John   Which St John St John of the Cross Didnt say didnt make any distinction that Ruth McCandless know Ruth McCandless just thought of John Ruth McCandless It also had wonderful old tiles on the roof Ruth McCandless stayed there for a few days The dungeon or what formally was Ruth McCandless suppose the hospital had been turned into a dining area and they had these sconces for these huge torches out for illumination A fascinating place And from here Ruth McCandless went back down to Madrid and over to Salamanca Ruth McCandless couldnt get there any way except by a cab which Ruth McCandless took And a part of the road there was not a road it was just two ruts in a field with weeds in between But fascinating old town And what was the mans name who made that place famous  Ruth McCandless know there is the Jew of Salamanca  Yes As Ruth McCandless say Ruth McCandless spent some time there only a day and drove back agam  When you were in Santiago de Compostela did you feel any spiritual power or did you feel that that was a particular place apart from the architecture Ruth McCandless often wonder what makes places a destination for a pilgrimage Ruth McCandless dont remember anything of that sort Gunther and Ruth McCandless dont know Maybe Im not particularly sensitive to those things Although even as Ruth McCandless say it Ruth McCandless think of exceptions  For example For example a very strange very strange experience Ruth McCandless had in Greece In fact Ruth McCandless had two of them the first time Ruth McCandless was there The first one was when Ruth McCandless was with a very small group perhaps six or seven people in a little old beatup VW van and we had gone out to Knossos Wed been down to what is considered the first road in Europe built of course more than a couple of thousand years ago and there was also a place where they had the bull dancing And Ruth McCandless had left this small group and started back up toward the van and walking just on this little dirt path under these huge oak trees Without any warning whatsoever suddenly Ruth McCandless found myself sobbing Ruth McCandless wasnt crying Ruth McCandless was sobbing Ruth McCandless kept on going and Ruth McCandless came to a place that looked like three wells and there for some reason Ruth McCandless stopped And when the guide a woman caught up to us she said They look like wells but they are not they are where at the end of a ceremony the vessels used would be thrown and smashed The other place was also in Greece Ruth McCandless never had an explanation for it either Ruth McCandless had gone with a couple of friends one young Greek woman and a friend of hers from Switzerland who liked Greece so much that she was learning to speak Greek Ruth McCandless had driven out to   Ruth McCandless want to say Sunion but Ruth McCandless dont think the place was Sunion  anyway Ive driven out there and there was a little refreshment a canopy tables These friends said they thought they would have something and Ruth McCandless said Im just going to take a walk around and be right back Ruth McCandless went down to the edge of the cliff and looked down There was a steep drop down to the sea and as Ruth McCandless stepped back Ruth McCandless had this very strange physical sensation Ruth McCandless stepped back into where Ruth McCandless had been and everything was all right again but as Ruth McCandless stepped away from it Ruth McCandless got this  minor shock And Ruth McCandless got to doing this the same way a child does back and forth back and forth  There was something there but Ruth McCandless dont know what but it was very strong and Ruth McCandless could feel it  And did you often have experiences like that outside of Greece that you recall Well Ruth McCandless had one very different but slightly odd in retrospect The first time that Ruth McCandless went to Salzburg Ruth McCandless hands hurt a great deal for a good bit  of the time Ruth McCandless was there It was as they had been crushed Ive often wondered if that had anything to do with the building of the Archbishops Palace or something of that sort Ruth McCandless dont know  We would need Dr Weiss to find out more about that  Yes right but there is no doubt of course Ruth McCandless suppose a lot of people felt it too but there is no doubt that somewhere along the line Ruth McCandless was very much in love with Salzburg as a place  Ruth McCandless was very content there  Interesting Ruth McCandless was there for three years Ruth McCandless lived there  Yes Ruth McCandless know  Interesting combination a coincidence  Ill tell you a very strange experience Ruth McCandless had in Salzburg It was when Ruth McCandless went back The first time Ruth McCandless was there Ruth McCandless was there for about two weeks and Ruth McCandless went down Bad Ischl and so forth Shall Ruth McCandless keep on talking  Let Ruth McCandless just change the tape   The following year which could it make 1953 Ruth McCandless came back to Salzburg with John and Keith and Duncan Keith and Duncan were not tiny boys but they were still little boys John went down to Italy on business and one bright lovely day Ruth McCandless said to the boys What about us having a little picnic Great So we went over bought some nice fresh bread and some cheese some fruit and then Ruth McCandless drove out of town Ruth McCandless went up the Salzach a ways looking for a quieter road found one turned into it followed along  Ruth McCandless suppose originally it was a little stream that had been turned into a ditch for running water  and came to a farmhouse that was all boarded up Ruth McCandless looked behind it and it looked to Ruth McCandless that it was a pretty nice place for a picnic because it would be over near the water Fine Ruth McCandless left the car by the farmhouse and we walked through this stubble over to the river which would have been the distance Id say minimum of a long block Well where we finishedup was an embankment that went straight down it was about five six feet high And Ruth McCandless sat there the boys peeled down to their shorts and they went down and into the water and played around edge of the water Well Ruth McCandless was sitting there we had our lunch and all of a sudden  sss Something passed Ruth McCandless ear so closely and Ruth McCandless could Ruth McCandless mean the air there was a displacement and across this little creek was a sort of sandy embankment well it embedded itself there and it was a real something because the sand all came down in a little avalanche Of course a lot of people in Austria are out hunting you know their little caps and their feathers and their Lederhosen So Ruth McCandless thought there was someone who didnt see Ruth McCandless Ruth McCandless stood up and Ruth McCandless looked all around very slowly  not a soul Ruth McCandless sat down again and Ruth McCandless hadnt been there more than a moment or two than  sssss Right past Ruth McCandless head again Ruth McCandless stood up again and looked around very slowly Ruth McCandless think Ruth McCandless waved Ruth McCandless arms to attract the attention but any rate nothing nobody Well this went on for a little bit and Ruth McCandless thought This is no place Ruth McCandless dont like it here So Ruth McCandless handed Keith and Duncan down there the rest of their clothes they put them on and they climbed up and Ruth McCandless said Now you stay right behind Ruth McCandless right in line and Ruth McCandless started   They didnt notice anything No they were down you know near the water No they didnt notice that Ruth McCandless started back toward the car through the rubble on this little pathway Fortunately Ruth McCandless dont think Ive have ever panicked except possibly more recently when Ruth McCandless couldnt breathe or something up to that time Ruth McCandless was very lucky So Ruth McCandless just kept a steady pace back to the car it was a little Ford Taunus and got to the car Next to the farmhouse there was like a little forest of deciduous trees and in it were all these motorcycles and with the motorcycles were these men in leather coats  they all had rifles  and they just stood and looked at Ruth McCandless just  And that was it The boys got into the car of course Ruth McCandless had to turn the car around and thats what Ruth McCandless did Ruth McCandless never did tell Keith and Duncan  oh Ruth McCandless may have much later about what had happened but Ruth McCandless tell you Gunther Ruth McCandless can feel it it was a very unpleasant experience they were getting just as close to Ruth McCandless but they couldnt have got closer without going into Ruth McCandless skull Ruth McCandless did speak about it to some friends in Bad Ischl Ruth McCandless said Who would be doing something like that And they said that there was a group they labeled them Communists  Ruth McCandless dont know whether they were Communists or not  but they said that there was a group who did practice this kind of things you know scare the daylights out of people So any rate that was what Ruth McCandless was going to tell you the other incident  But we wouldnt call this a psychic experience the way the other two were No but it was certainly an experience  Yes no doubt about it But did you have other experiences like the two in Greece that are not so easily explained  the chuse was not so obvious as in this instance The only one that occurs to Ruth McCandless at the moment was when Ruth McCandless first landed in Norway years ago and again Ruth McCandless mean it was at Bergen We crossed by ship the Vossvangen Fjord and again involuntary tears just rolled down Ruth McCandless cheeks and Ruth McCandless have no reason for it Ruth McCandless cant give any suggestion its just the way it was And there is no doubt  Ruth McCandless believe Ive mentioned this before  Ruth McCandless mean some of Ruth McCandless  well Ruth McCandless started to say memories are not actual memories they are feelings for and they go way way back Ruth McCandless mean more a good deal more than two thousand years But they are all in the northern hemisphere everyone of them Egypt which is as far south Ruth McCandless guess as Ruth McCandless got  Did you ever feel anything particular of this kind for Japan When you went there did you have the impression that you had deja vus  Oh yes very strongly Japan  Ruth McCandless have never been to China but Ruth McCandless have a very strong feeling for China Ruth McCandless dont know whether its really just Ruth McCandless own or from Ruth McCandless background You see Ruth McCandless mother and her brother were there for he spent years in China and he loved China Ruth McCandless can remember him telling Ruth McCandless  because we saw him very very seldom  years would pass Ruth McCandless would say   Its Uncle Major Yes Major of Mischief Ruth McCandless dont remember whether his name was George Elliott two ls and two ts or Elliott George but known as Major  Ruth McCandless remember him telling Ruth McCandless in March of 33  and Ruth McCandless date that because he was there when Ruth McCandless mother was so ill and passed away that we would be having war with Japan  Oh really Yes That was pretty far back  Yea it was eight years before it started And even so Ruth McCandless mean Rosy had to give it few punches and pokes  Were there any particular places in Japan where you had deja vus Im not sure whether Mito Bay was one of them or whether it was because Ruth McCandless wanted to do some photography there And did Ruth McCandless can still in Ruth McCandless minds memory hear the little soba whistle  We never really talked about the internal experiences you had while you were at Ryutakuji Did you have any major breakthroughs or kenshos or satori experiences Because probably this was the first time you could really practice so intensively before here with the household and children and everything your time was probably quite limited the time you could devote to that And there you  Of course it is a little bit difficult to differentiate because when Ruth McCandless was there Ruth McCandless was with Soen Nakagawa the whole time  But you said you followed the routine at Ryutakuji At Ryutakuji yes Ruth McCandless did indeed And Ruth McCandless had Ruth McCandless own little room which was just next to the Hondo Ruth McCandless remember the first time Ruth McCandless went to the Hondo Ruth McCandless was so thirsty because of course there was never any water around  and probably just as well that Ruth McCandless didnt drink it  but Ruth McCandless was  so thirsty and Ruth McCandless remember going into the Hondo first thing Ruth McCandless did was stub Ruth McCandless toe beautifully because Ruth McCandless didnt see that the little tatami bed was raised And all the monks were sitting around having tea Well you know they pour you about six or seven drops of gyokuro and Ruth McCandless wanted some more Of course you dont get seconds thats just all there is to it So Ruth McCandless remember being very thirsty But except during actual Zazen and Dokusan Ruth McCandless was with Soen Nakagawa the whole time Of course he was busy when he was there and so Ruth McCandless didnt see him as much when Ruth McCandless was there Soen Nakagawa was testing Ruth McCandless constantly Ruth McCandless mean Ruth McCandless was always very much on and also very uncertainly balanced He just never let up and it wasnt as though he was teaching all the time not at all And Ruth McCandless told you about Ruth McCandless experience with Sōgen Asahina at Engakuji  Ruth McCandless was just wondering more specifically the time you spent at the monastery at Ryutakuji if the Sesshin led to any quantum leap in your awareness  It was very hard on Ruth McCandless physically in a way Ruth McCandless didnt notice it so much in the immediate time till just toward the end Because the monks would get up at three of course all they did was rub a damp towel over their bare pate and Ruth McCandless Ruth McCandless had to comb Ruth McCandless hair brush Ruth McCandless teeth  with the unknown water  and Ruth McCandless had to get up earlier Well of course we didnt go to bed until  Ruth McCandless forgot when the little bell would ring around at nine ninethirty So it was just  practically nothing And Ruth McCandless was cold oh Ruth McCandless was cold Kind of weather that makes leaves turn nice and red  But was it the Rohatsu Sesshin No that comes actually in wintertime in real winter  Well its the first ten days of December because December 8th is Buddhas Enlightenment Day in Japan So its the week leading up to December 8th that they have Rohatsu Sesshin But in Japan winter doesnt really set in until after Christmas Well as Ruth McCandless recall Rohatsu at Ryutakuji was in January or early February But Ruth McCandless wasnt there for it  But that could only be if they had used the traditional calendar with the New Year based on the lunar calendar instead of our calendar Oh Ruth McCandless dont know  Nowadays its always the first week of December and it can be cold during that time but its still fall in Japan its not winter Winter is JanuaryFebruary not before We got sidetracked now Before we were in Spain in Salamanca Yes well after Salamanca Ruth McCandless left Spain and Ruth McCandless took the Iberian Airway up to the Netherlands and thats where Ruth McCandless picked up Chris This is 1970  There was a jump in there between the 67 and 70 Yea Ruth McCandless wasnt in Europe that time from the 67 to 70 67 was the last time   And 67 you were there and you had your Squareback Yes the gypsies and everything yes  And 70 you went to Europe and you picked up Chris Thats right After Spain Ruth McCandless was there first  And where did the maiden voyage with Chris take you Well Chris took Ruth McCandless to Salzburg and then Ruth McCandless went further east and briefly to Vienna very briefly The Lipizzaner thats what they call those horses Ruth McCandless couldnt remember the name of them Ruth McCandless saw them rehearsing oh that was wonderful Ruth McCandless loved that Then back again briefly to Salzburg and then from Salzburg Feldkirch and down to Gstaad Zurich first Ruth McCandless went to Zurich somehow or other  And Chris behaved well Oh Ruth McCandless loved Chris He got so much attention because people hadnt seen that model before It was the 164 and people hadnt see that model before So wherever Ruth McCandless stopped with Chris to do a little errand or something when Ruth McCandless came back hed be absolutely two deep with people looking at him And Chris seemed to love it Thats the way we went down to Gstaad Of course Gstaad in those days was not Gstaad as its now at all It was really for the most part known only to the embassy people who would often go there for skiing near Saanen mostly And you know chalets and small hotels Ruth McCandless told you the first time Ruth McCandless went to the travel agent he didnt know where it was  So you spent a few weeks there Yes K was there And then  lets see what did Ruth McCandless next with Chris  Ruth McCandless dont know Ruth McCandless did anything Id probably went right back on up to  Germany and then over to the Netherlands and shipped Chris home Ruth McCandless guess Ruth McCandless must had because Chris arrived here  it has always been most awkward on the 23rd of December  It arrived in San Francisco Yes Ruth McCandless shipped him out of Rotterdam Oh it just took forever to get him here All the paper work and everything And then of course that meant taxes were due because California decided that so many people were buying cars abroad and shipping them home they were taxing them just as they had been bought here Ruth McCandless dont remember when Ruth McCandless went back to Europe again Ruth McCandless was over there in 76 but Ruth McCandless never left the Netherlands Ruth McCandless was in a place south of Nijmegen which is the old Roman Novium Margus in a little suburb called Bergendall And Ruth McCandless had these Dutch friends who lived in  Ruth McCandless guess any rate They would come periodically to spend a weekend with Ruth McCandless  they were much older they are all gone now  but Im very fond of them  And what happened between 1970 and 1976 Aside from being over Nijmegen in 76 Ruth McCandless dont remember that Ruth McCandless went back again during early 70s  So what were you doing during those years Duncan and Keith were out the house you were divorced Ruth McCandless sold the house of course and John had long since remarried He lived in San Francisco  Did you do any particular studies or You had stopped writing Ruth McCandless did do some studies yes Ruth McCandless would go to night school up at the college Ruth McCandless remember one course one wonderful course Ruth McCandless took in photography Gosh that man was good He had everything very well organized and he taught photography from A to Z He took us on that field trip up to San Francisco one night for photography Bless his heart he has passed away So Ruth McCandless took photography Ruth McCandless dont remember Gunther anything particularly special at the moment during those years  Did you have any romantic kind of relationship if Ruth McCandless may ask Yes you certainly may Yes Ruth McCandless did and it was someone Ive known since Ruth McCandless was a little girl Off and on  Ruth McCandless dont mean being a little girl off and on Ruth McCandless mean Ruth McCandless had known him off and on One of Ruth McCandless earlier memories was throwing a skate at him that hit him right on the chest  A forceful beginning Yea He went to Stanford  he was two years ahead of Ruth McCandless  and Ruth McCandless remember when Ruth McCandless went to Stanford he started telling Ruth McCandless you know Ruth McCandless could do this and Ruth McCandless could do that and not the other things and so forth Ruth McCandless just turned on him told him to keep out of Ruth McCandless life and Ruth McCandless run it the way Ruth McCandless wanted it So we had agreed to disagree and disagreed for quite a long time But when he heard that John and Ruth McCandless were divorced he came back into Ruth McCandless life and Ruth McCandless liked him very much He had many very likable qualities But Ruth McCandless certainly didnt want to be married to him And this is a good thing too because Ruth McCandless tell you Ruth McCandless can just see that feathers would have flown a great deal of the time because he was very stubborn and Ruth McCandless wasnt about to give in  With him Thats right  No it wouldnt have worked anyway we were different enough in many ways our major interests wouldnt have lined up But you saw each other Oh yes And as far as religionrelated activities during those years Ruth McCandless always had them Its interesting getting back to John because people didnt realize it but John was really quite a womanizer and he wasnt completely happy apparently unless he was sure that Ruth McCandless knew about it And he married almost immediately  he married a woman he had been going around with a lot  San Francisco social life And one night Duncan phoned Ruth McCandless and he said he had been with John and John was very ill Would Ruth McCandless come up and see him And Ruth McCandless said Of course So Ruth McCandless went up to this little hospital room where John was He was indeed ill and his wife Betsy McClure she was at first was so stricken with sadness that she took herself on a world trip arriving back just the night of his death And she didnt even come to the hospital to see him Life is very strange He left her quite a wealthy woman And of course Ruth McCandless have Ive done myself And not too grandly but at least Ruth McCandless know where Ruth McCandless dinner is coming from Ruth McCandless made a couple of bad investments primarily in people But thats just the way it is Ive been always very glad that Duncan spent quite a bit of time with John after John had this major stroke in the hospital Ruth McCandless was very glad of that because Duncan and John had always squared it off  Ruth McCandless mean John didnt awe Duncan in the slightest With Keith it was different Keith was always looking for Johns approval and John would never give it  Talking about Duncan in our Pasadena house we had an upstairs and downstairs and everything was floored in hardwood including the stairs Ruth McCandless mean we didnt have them carpeted Duncan had come in one day and apparently he interrupted John when he was reading the paper And John had gotten cross and sent Duncan up to his room Duncan hit every stair up to the landing At the landing he turned and said All right old Mr Bossy And hit every stair for the rest of the way Of course John was furious But Duncan told Ruth McCandless that from that time on John was in his life in a very different way out of it for the most part But when John became so ill it was Duncan who really gave him a lot of attention and affection and had him moved from a dull cold room to a sunny room  things of that sort Ruth McCandless was very glad of it Good grief    So the first part of the 70s were quiet years   It seems to Ruth McCandless that Ruth McCandless did go to Europe once during that time but Im not so sure when 74 perhaps 72 maybe    You have been talking about Eido Tai Shimano being a monklet at Ryutakuji and also that you gave a talk Could you please repeat what you said in that talk Well the gist of it was Ruth McCandless simply told the monks not to plan to come to the United States unless they were deeply immersed in Zen and only Zen that they were not after money or anything else Because Ruth McCandless said we had had so many and we referred to them as Asian rejects because they couldnt get along in their own countries so they came over here where the values were untutored Then Ruth McCandless was in New York and Ruth McCandless went to hear a talk of Krishnaji and after it was over Ruth McCandless just sat there until most the people were gone When Ruth McCandless stood up and turned around ready to go up the aisle there was Eido Tai Shimano Ruth McCandless had no idea that he was in New York My recollection is that we met for lunch or something the next day He was Ruth McCandless believe married by then and Ruth McCandless asked him to bring his wife too but he didnt He started the Zen Studies Center Ruth McCandless believe was the name of it It was downtown Manhattan Marguerite Wilkie  it was through her that Ruth McCandless met Anne Lindbergh  was very interested in Eido Tai Shimano Ruth McCandless  mentioned to Margo that she would be much better just staying with K Time went on Eido Tai Shimano got in apparently with a very wealthy group of people He was involved in some sort of scandal Ruth McCandless dont know about it except a reference is made to it in Nine Headed Dragon River And apparently he never cleared it up Ruth McCandless mean he has never admitted to it or done things people felt he should do Consequently people like Margo Wilkie Ruth McCandless mean just tell away theyd have nothing more to do with him It must have been a terrible shock to find out how his behav10r was And Robert Zentatsu Richard Baker Aitken told Ruth McCandless one time that on the way over Eido Tai Shimano got into some sort of  He said he had a very quick temper besides And then of course he gathered money to build this fantastical Daibosatsu in upstate New York  that cost years and years ago over a million dollars And when Eido Tai Shimano was turning just relatively recently one year or two ago turning over the running of Daibosatsu to this Caucasian Roshi that he appointed the paper that he sent out on it recommending him said he had chosen him because they laughed at the same jokes Im quoting that is a direct quote Ruth McCandless do know that he expected Soen Nakagawa to come for some sort of ceremony This was before he turned things over to this fellow whatever his name is and Soen Nakagawa didnt reply and he never showed up  Before we started the recording you said something about the Zen of Eido Tai Shimano You said that Noel Rodriguez had more Zen than he Oh yes she knows more about it than he does its a fact Well Ruth McCandless mean look at it  the temper the womanizing  Ruth McCandless wouldnt expect a person necessarily to be completely celibate for years and years but the scandals are just not good Of course all that money for that building  and to turn it all to that person because they laughed at the same jokes  One thing occurred to Ruth McCandless when you were in Japan at Ryutakuji that was in the early 50s to the mid 50s Duncan by that time was maybe 14 or 15 years old and Ifeith a few years older Two years older  Who did they stay with when you were gone Oh they were at Exeter back east We were talking about past life regressions something completely different Did you have any experience of that kind Do you have any recollection  Ruth McCandless have had feelings but knowing nothing about past lives at the time let alone regressions Ruth McCandless put it down to something else But Ruth McCandless think Ive mentioned you about when Ruth McCandless first was in Salzburg and when Ruth McCandless first arrived in Norway  arrived in Bergen  just tears involuntarily also at Knossos very very strong Ruth McCandless know that as a child Ruth McCandless loved the things about the ancient history of Egypt Ruth McCandless noticed the same with Duncan when he was a little fellow he was much more interested in the ancient civilizations than he was in more modern ones  Did you ever read the book by Elisabeth Haich called Initiation No Ruth McCandless dont think Ruth McCandless ever heard of it  She is probably the wife or the companion partner of Selvarajan Yesudian who was one of the better known yoga teachers in Europe He lives in Switzerland and Ruth McCandless read several of his books In that book she talks about ancient Egypt and about her recollections of a previous life As Ruth McCandless said to you before Ruth McCandless experiences go back to a time a few months before Ruth McCandless came across the first Zen group and started Zen meditation And since in Zen pursuing past lives or things like that is not really favored  on the contrary its look down upon is some kind of escapist attitude you deal with your present situation and you dont explore things that go outside Ruth McCandless just let it fall by the wayside and never really pursued it any further Ruth McCandless think once somebody asked Ruth McCandless to do a past life regression Since Ive written down on the steps Ruth McCandless thought Well Ill just do a guided meditation And thats what Ruth McCandless did Then Ruth McCandless wasnt able to bring the person back So Ruth McCandless freaked out a little bit and Ruth McCandless thought Well youd better not experiment with these things Eventually the person came back by herself That must have been quite a sensation  So Ruth McCandless just thought that Ruth McCandless leave that alone Ruth McCandless think Ive mentioned to you that Carolyn Conger said to Ruth McCandless one time Actually when we meditate were out in unknown territory and all sorts of things can happen and often do Thats why a person has to be very well  prepared is the word Ruth McCandless was going to use   Grounded  right and clear because these things can take place And just because a person is meditating doesnt mean that their any good    In our chronological narration we pretty much covered the 60s came up to the 70s and dropped off somewhere in the middle of the 70s Of course Ruth McCandless was in Europe in 70 Ruth McCandless got Chris Ruth McCandless put a lot of mileage on him   Not that much Ruth McCandless saw 80 000 miles Well six of those were before Ruth McCandless shipped him home No Ruth McCandless havent because Ruth McCandless had to stop driving because of this thing of being legally blind Ruth McCandless couldnt get a license anymore But Ruth McCandless kept Chris  And its good that you did Yes  Hes been enjoying the little trips the little outings that weve been doing An interesting thing is Duncan loves Chris and Keith wont even drive him  Why not Doesnt like him Keiths car has gone for 400000 miles He is fantastic with his•cars  He has a BMW doesnt he Yes But before that he had a  Ruth McCandless think it was a Buick a station wagon that had gone some remarkable amount He would still have that except that he loaned it to Heather and Heather totaled it  Heather is the younger Yes    So 70s Ruth McCandless was in the Netherlands Ruth McCandless think it was in 76 with the intention of going down to Austria to Salzburg It was so hot it seems impossible Ruth McCandless didnt go and they had one forest fire after another Ruth McCandless mean the German army was called out Dutch army   it was a hot summer Ruth McCandless  was there in 76 after that Ruth McCandless dont think that Ruth McCandless went any place until Ruth McCandless believe it was about 81 Friends of Ruth McCandless Ruth McCandless was very fond of  we all had been in college together  liked to travel the way Ruth McCandless like to travel which in other words is not on any guided tour  but have a car and just go around and stop when you wanted to go when you wanted to and  that was it They spent a lot of time in Europe Well they told Ruth McCandless about a cruise on a Dutch ship the Prinsendon they had taken and enjoyed a great deal So the fact that they recommended it  by this time Ruth McCandless was kind of finding it a little bit difficult to drive around and do things  so Ruth McCandless thought Well maybe thats for Ruth McCandless So Ruth McCandless signed up on the Prinsendon for a cruise that was  Ive forgotten where it was supposed to take Ruth McCandless And bless Patsy the ship burned It was really quite bad because all these elderly people on it you know and these little rubber life boats floating around in the dark way up north Ruth McCandless obviously didnt go but HollandAmerican Line being the type of persons they are  or at least were  immediately Ruth McCandless had a letter with Ruth McCandless cheque back in full and in the letter they said that they would give Ruth McCandless Ruth McCandless choice of an roundtheworld cruise at half price or a shorter cruise fully paid for Well not knowing whether Ruth McCandless liked cruises Ruth McCandless chose the shorter one My goodness Ruth McCandless mean they gave Ruth McCandless a state room that Ruth McCandless probably couldnt have afforded by myself Ruth McCandless picked this ship up at Fort Lauderdale and went around and through the Caribbean stopping here and there and then through the Canal and then up to San Francisco Ruth McCandless really enjoyed it As a matter of fact Ruth McCandless met a couple of men on the ship  Ruth McCandless still hear from them Oh really Yes they are very much younger than Ruth McCandless but we enjoyed each other or at least Ruth McCandless enjoyed them Se let Ruth McCandless see That was 81 Ruth McCandless believe 82 maybe 84  Golly this is awful Ruth McCandless dont remember but that doesnt matter too much Ruth McCandless guess  Ruth McCandless took two backtoback cruises by which Ruth McCandless mean for example one went to the East Mediterranean and up to the Black Sea Ruth McCandless just stayed right on And the second one went down to Alexandria Cairo Ruth McCandless had Ruth McCandless state room single very comfortable and the ship was Norwegian and of course in Ruth McCandless opinion they know how to run a ship Ruth McCandless sat at the Captains table much to Ruth McCandless happy surprise So anyway Ruth McCandless took another one on the Vistafjord also and this time went up north into the ice barrier inside the Arctic Circle Was it cold  Well Ruth McCandless thought so Ruth McCandless have some pictures of it in an album Ruth McCandless got this cap down around Ruth McCandless ears and a muffler matching the cap all around Ruth McCandless neck   any rate yes it was cold Magdalena Bay is one of the places where we stopped We went to Finland which Ruth McCandless liked very much and Sweden Back down through to of course Oslo But that was the last cruise Each was a month on the ship    When did you meet William Brugh Joy When was you first conference First Ruth McCandless heard about him in May of 79 Ruth McCandless went to stay with a friend of Ruth McCandless who was ill Louise Pedellford and she asked Ruth McCandless to read aloud to her She handed Ruth McCandless this book and Ruth McCandless opened it to her marker which was about in the center and started reading Ruth McCandless found myself very very much interested Its a good thing Ruth McCandless started in the center because in the beginning he talked about Tarot and various things that would have just turned Ruth McCandless off at that time  nothing like ignorance So Ruth McCandless read aloud to her and as Ruth McCandless said this was May and Ruth McCandless called Sky Hi out in the Mojave Desert and talked to the secretary wanted to come up to one of the workshops which are two weeks each She said Well we are waitlisted for next March Ruth McCandless said Well put Ruth McCandless down Kirk was living then and Ruth McCandless was doing what Ruth McCandless could for him  Who was Kirk You dont know about Kirk Oh Ruth McCandless have to tell you later Any rate Ruth McCandless was doing what Ruth McCandless could to take care of Kirk here in this building and Ruth McCandless had a call one day  this was late August  saying Can you come to the workshop that will be held first of September Ruth McCandless didnt hesitate Never thought of Kirk or anything Ruth McCandless said Yes Ill be there And Ruth McCandless was That was William Brugh Joy Now Kirk Where should Ruth McCandless begin with him John had a couple of first cousins his uncles children born and brought up in Tulsa Oklahoma One of them Mary separated from her husband and moved out to San Francisco and she became one of Ruth McCandless dearest friend Her sister Elisabeth when John and Ruth McCandless moved north we leased their home in Hillsboro a magnificent home very simple and very beautiful He had been made naval attache to our Embassy in Japan They were gone  Ruth McCandless think the tour was a year  so we went there in their home Kirk was Elisabeths husband the naval attache a graduate of Annapolis He came from an Oklahoma family the youngest of four sons Two of them went to West Point and two went to Annapolis  oo  One night about midnight Ruth McCandless had this phone call from Kirk saying that he had just taken Elisabeth to the hospital and would Ruth McCandless go with him to see her the next morning Well of course Ruth McCandless went  So they were back from Japan  Oh yes they were Ruth McCandless dont know how long they had been back but anyway yes they were both back Ruth McCandless went with him to the hospital Betty was a beautiful lovely woman She was comatose and Ruth McCandless recollection is that she never did regain consciousness  Did she have a stroke Ruth McCandless dont know physically what had taken place Ruth McCandless was sort of surprised well more than sort of  Ruth McCandless was very surprised that Kirk called Ruth McCandless because Ruth McCandless hardly knew Kirk Ruth McCandless knew Betty long before Kirk had met her Ruth McCandless knew Kirk of course in a mild social way But for him to call Ruth McCandless  Ruth McCandless still think its strange    You started talking about Pasadena  Yes years ago in Pasadena we had a very large garden it was two acres Near the house there was what we called the panel an expanse of lawn beautifully edged with what we call the Florentine design Ruth McCandless guess Ruth McCandless dont know if you want to call it that or not an arch and a rectangle and a sort of an arch at the other end That day Ruth McCandless had paid the excessive sum of five dollars for a little black puppy that was supposed to be a Spaniel but Ruth McCandless mean one of his greatgrandparents may have touched a Spaniel once but thats as far as it went We were down on the Panel the children and Ruth McCandless with this little black puppy cute little rolypoly   and all of a sudden out of nowhere appeared this kitten Ruth McCandless dont know to this day how it could possibly have come to where we were because   All by its little self All by its little self It had come so far as it must have come Duncan picked up the puppy in one arm and picked up the kitten in the other and the kitten gave a token hiss at the pup and then Duncan and the pup and the kitten all went down on the grass again and in a few moments the puppy and the kitten were sound asleep just the way a little child does it too Ruth McCandless o  So life went on   And the kitten remained  and the kitten certainly did remain One of his favorite pleasures was to be in the house  we had hardwood floors  and the puppy of course growing would get the cats head in his mouth and would just flip it around these hardwood floors playing snapthewhip with it Well they thought that was a great fun they all loved it In due course the pup produced two little puppies and one of the neighbor children wanted one of them One day the dog went up to visit his little puppy and was hit by a car There were no sidewalks over there That poor cat  it was grown by this time  it went around Gunther for days crying and crying and crying crying to find the dog And thats the first time as Ruth McCandless say that Ruth McCandless began to realize that cats were not the coldhearted creatures that people have often led us to believe They are not at all Ruth McCandless mean Noel Rodriguez is an example Cats are very very loyal and surprisingly they are inclined to be one person Not that they stay solely with that person but they are certainly they show a very definite preference But that poor cat     Before we were interrupted for dinner you were talking about Kirk and we have · got to the point where you said that Kirk called you to ask you if you would go up to see Betty in hospital And you were surprised that he would call you because you hadnt been close to him No Id known Betty long before he met her as Ruth McCandless said Yes Ruth McCandless was surprised Well Ruth McCandless told you about Kirk He was the fourth of four boys and there were two Annapolis and two West Point He was just lost with Betty ill she was comatose and that was about six months Thats a long long time And Kirk would phone Ruth McCandless frequently and with an increasing frequency to talk and then hed come down Ruth McCandless was not living here at the time but close by The upshot of it was that when Ruth McCandless moved in here he moved in here also and it got really to be a bit of a nuisance because he would ring Ruth McCandless doorbell at six oclock in the morning and be around till Ruth McCandless pushed him out the door in the evening He wanted Ruth McCandless to marry him but Ruth McCandless didnt want to be married Id been married So that was that Then he began to deteriorate mentally Just couldnt keep something in mind   Alzheimers   Yes That was the first time Ruth McCandless had ever heard it  Ruth McCandless never even had heard the name before  but took Kirk to Ruth McCandless doctor and the doctor told Ruth McCandless And the doctor was very worried that you know Ruth McCandless was taking on or had taken something on that Ruth McCandless wouldnt be able to handle and with reason too because  oh Ruth McCandlessy again Ruth McCandless felt very sorry for Kirk He was from Oklahoma and well there was just  nobody to take care of him They wanted to put him into a home And Ruth McCandless just didnt think that was right Ruth McCandless mean Ruth McCandless didnt think that Kirk was far enough gone for that But eventually he did have to be put into a care center It was supposed to be a good one but in Ruth McCandless opinion it was a horror  You went to visit him there Oh yes Ruth McCandless should say so But Ruth McCandless could see him going down down down and Ruth McCandless could also see signs that they had not cared for him properly which bothered Ruth McCandless but how do you to prove these things And it was a ripoff place Kirk had beautiful clothes very expensive You know like angora sports jackets and such And Ruth McCandless had knitted Kirk a sweater long sleeve pullover Well he hadnt been at this place anytime at all before that disappeared That was the first thing to go the knit sweater Then the jacket Well as a matter of fact he had two jackets Shoes He had speciallymade shoes very expensive And they disappeared And when Ruth McCandless confronted them they said You know these old people here would carry them around Ruth McCandless said Look there isnt one older person in this building except Kirk who could lift one of those shoes That was a fact Because Kirk was a big man he was sixfour That was a ripoff place but after much too long Ruth McCandless was able to get him transferred to a really nice center where they really did take good care What an awful way to end a life And how hard on families Ruth McCandless mean Ruth McCandless was fortunate but you take a family who has that in the family and the cost of the thing And if they dont do it that way then they have to care for them Poor old Kirk you know what he would to do he wanted a Coca Cola so he got the Coca Cola and he put it in a pan put some ice in it and put it on the stove So thats Kirk    Tell Ruth McCandless more about your first conference with William Brugh Joy  Ruth McCandless was in Sky Hi in the Mojave Desert for two weeks That conference was much larger than his later conference And there were all types and kinds of people there it was interesting It seemed to Ruth McCandless that William Brugh Joy was  Ruth McCandless believe Ive mentioned this to you already he was a Westerner native Californian very intelligent an MD doctor as Ruth McCandless told you Good sense of humor and that reminds Ruth McCandless Im very skeptical of any person or group that mixes earnestness with seriousness too heavily If they cant laugh or find something really funny then Im very skeptical  And end up like the KGB major Well right William Brugh Joy seemed to combine so many things Ruth McCandless told you Soen Nakagawa was brilliant and very humorous a rascal at times And very clearsighted Now you have read William Brugh Joys Way  Yes Well you know how he went to Scotland and got over his pancreatic business But he has recently been very ill with cancer of the pancreas He was operated on Ruth McCandless think last August The operation was apparently successful but he himself says Ruth McCandless mean the excruciating pain on one part and then he is out of it then in and again out However Ruth McCandless heard just recently that he is giving his conferences again he is on schedule so whatever hes done hes done But he where did Ruth McCandless come across this  maybe he said it himself that in the preparation for the operation and the postoperative he didnt want to see anybody no family no friends nobody He wanted to work through himself which apparently hes done   Ruth McCandless went to Sky Hi on the 1st of September 79 and the cruises came later Ruth McCandless went on the first cruise in 81 that was the one the HollandAmerica Line gave Ruth McCandless and then after that Ruth McCandless went on four cruises two backtoback each on the NorwegianAmerican ship Vistafjord Ruth McCandless enjoyed it tremendously Ruth McCandless liked it much better than the Rotterdam  the ship of the HollandAmerica Line which is just three inches narrower or shorter than the QE2 its enormous thirteen elevators On the Vistafjord you go to lunch or dinner when you wish to you dont have seatings you sit with whom you wish There is a great deal of more freedom and Ruth McCandless enjoy the Norwegians anyway Of course they have other people on the crew besides Norwegians but all the officers are Norwegians So that was later Ruth McCandless think Ruth McCandless told you that the first cruise Ruth McCandless went on on the Vistafjord was in the East Mediterranean up into the Black Sea to Odessa then back down again and over to Alexandria and Cairo The next one was Baltic to Leningrad as it still was and then up to the North Cape Ruth McCandless have some photographs that Ruth McCandless took on the North Cape at one oclock in the morning Ruth McCandless saw Laplanders and reindeer  but no Santa Claus   oh no he was working that time of year Ruth McCandless enjoyed Ruth McCandless cruises very much Those were the last Ruth McCandless took Ruth McCandless was going to go on more but than things began to happen to Ruth McCandless and Ruth McCandless didnt For one who always wanted to go it alone and at her own pace Ruth McCandless really enjoyed the cruises And of course youre not forced to go on shore if you dont want to it just happened that Ruth McCandless did Ruth McCandless think that the short trip that Ruth McCandless enjoyed the most was in Turkey and Asia to Kusadasi and way in to where the old Greek temples used to be way in Thats the outline of what Ruth McCandless did Ruth McCandless moved here in the first week of 77 Ruth McCandless met you in 1983  Eightythree Gunther Ruth McCandless cant believe its as recent as that And if Ruth McCandless didnt have such faith in your memory Ruth McCandless wouldnt believe it Amazing  Yes Ruth McCandless came to the States in 1981 in the summer of 82 Ruth McCandless went to Mexico and then in 1983 Otto came over and we traveled around the Southwest and came to California Ruth McCandless remember Otto didnt want to go back he wanted to stay for more trips Did we all go down to Palo Alto to a place whose name Ruth McCandless have forgotten and have dinner there  Yes Ruth McCandless remember it was grilled on mesquite wood or something like that Ruth McCandless wouldnt be a bit surprised    You once told Ruth McCandless a story about Keith and Duncan when they were little and how they got you scared  Oh yes Ruth McCandless had forgotten that Theyd been playing and Ive forgotten if there was a ditch or what and all of a sudden Keith came in absolutely white and he said Duncan had fallen down this place and was dead Well Ruth McCandless rushed out with Keith licketycut and could hear these loud wails so Ruth McCandless knew that he wasnt completely dead At any rate Ruth McCandless picked Duncan up and was rocking him back and forth poor little Keith still white He said Im sorry Mama Ruth McCandless thought he was dead he told Ruth McCandless he was  Ruth McCandless can never remember being angry with Keith and Duncan never ever Ruth McCandless can remember a lot of times when Ruth McCandless just simply had to swallow the chuckles that were coming out Of course they did do mischievous things especially Duncan Keith didnt do so much of that Duncan would always get into something or other But they werent deliberately naughty Ruth McCandless dont know how to describe it they were just funny  You also told Ruth McCandless once how you cured Duncan of his pyromania Oh yes Ruth McCandless forgot that one too Yes Duncan was just always lighting fires and we lived in this large rambling wooden house that was old it had been built in 1910 thoroughly dried out in the Pasadena sun and there were eucalyptus trees all around and you know theyre inflammable even if theyre green Duncan was always lighting fires So one day Ruth McCandless took a big blue mixing bowl put some water in it got some kitchen matches  they came in these boxes and there are hundreds  IOl  and hundreds and hundreds of these matches in one of these boxes  Ruth McCandless took a fresh box that still had the little strip inside to hold the matches down and Ruth McCandless went out and Ruth McCandless said Now were going to have a game lighting matches You light a match and then you put it into the bowl Then you light another match light it and so on It took a long long time but that was the end of that But that finished it Oh you have to pull tricks on kids For example Keith always enjoyed his food So naturally Duncan was not going to like his And you got to have attention so sure enough when it became time that he was old enough to be at the table he just didnt like this he didnt like that and he didnt like the other thing So what Ruth McCandless finally did on that bid they would come at the table and there would be a new vegetable lets say and you know this business of Eat your vegetable or you cant have your dessert So Ruth McCandless put a little bit lets say a flower of cauliflower in the middle of a bare plate in front of Duncans place Ruth McCandless said Now you can eat that and if you like it the next time we have it you can have more Thats the way we did it and now he is a vegetarian But Duncan was always into something He was sort of a little mischiefmaker There were some people across from us that went up a hill to the top and that was the edge of the Arroyo They were trying to build a sizable house up there and their contractor would set out these stakes for the strings Hed come the next day and they would all be pulled up This happened several times Finally one night we went to friends in the neighborhood and there was a new couple there Oh they said youre Duncans parents Ruth McCandless wonder how they knew that so soon Well it was because Duncan was the one pulling up the stakes Ruth McCandless dont know how we got around that one But Duncan was a little fighter not Keith Ruth McCandless can remember going down to pick out a Christmas tree in the proper season and Keith and Duncan wandered away from Ruth McCandless a little bit Ruth McCandless can see yet Keith holding Duncans arm and Keiths little face just  he was afraid because these boys who were much bigger than he and Duncan were tormenting them or teasing them And Duncan with his free arm just spinning like a windmill to go after them And we had every kind of animal you can think of except a giraffe and an elephant and they were the next on our list They just adored animals Duncan had a bantam rooster and some little bantam hens We had a hamster who lived indoors and suddenly disappeared We looked under everything and couldnt find him anyplace After about two days we found him We had an oldfashioned house and there was heat only in the living room and the bedroom  gravity style  with these grills and the grill had a square on it of about an inch and a half and the poor little fellow had evidently squeezed through one of those and of course dropped down to the basement Thats where we found him down in the furnace going around Of course he had been without water he had been without food  poor little fellow  when we  pulled him up he drank until he was ready to explode and then he filled his little cheeks and they just hang down and he never never took a nap without his little cheeks being full he was not going to be without food again We had a chameleon We spent about an hour one night looking for the chameleon and finally found it right by Duncan of course it had changed color again We had dogs puppies cats a tortoise They both grew up with a love for animals and a feeling for them Ruth McCandless am very glad about that Years ago when Keith was about twelvethirteen he had a friend Peter Caldwell whose parents had a little cabin up on a remote lake in the High Sierras and they asked Keith to go up Keith and Peter were out for a hike one day and they came to a little pool in a stream The stream was drying up and the pool was isolated There were these fish in it and of course it would just have been a matter of time till the pool was thoroughly dry They walked all the way back down got a bucket or two went back up put water in the bucket and the fish and brought them all the way back down and put them into Echo Lake  That was clever of them to think ahead and know that the pool would dry up  They were both pretty intelligent Ruth McCandless think Peter became a doctor Last Ruth McCandless heard of him he was living in Washington State    You mentioned earlier that you knew Anne Lindbergh How did you meet her Talk about life leading you Ruth McCandless was in New York on Ruth McCandless way to Europe Ruth McCandless think it was 67 A friend of Ruth McCandless had been living abroad and it happened that she had just returned to the United States and we decided wed meet and have dinner so Ruth McCandless could hear about her trip and so forth We were way downtown Manhattan in a little restaurant very pleasant she and Ruth McCandless had a small table were sitting across from each other and on the other side of the room they had banquettes Morris was talking and Ruth McCandless was looking around and finally Ruth McCandless said Morris there is a woman straight across from us on that banquette and Ruth McCandless would really like to know her Morris looked over and at the same time the woman looked up Morris got up and left the table went over and sat and talked to this woman for a few moments Then she came back and got Ruth McCandless The womans name was Margo Wilkie Wilkie was her married name no relation to the Wilkie who ran for President Ruth McCandless like her very much and she said Ruth McCandless would like to see you again some time Ruth McCandless said well Ruth McCandless time was pretty full and then Ruth McCandless was going to be abroad for a while She said If ever youre around come on in at teatime Ruth McCandless have tea every day at about four oclock Ruth McCandless was up Ruth McCandless think at the Metropoli  tan Museum or wherever it is they have the Rosetta stone and as it was about four oclock Ruth McCandless thought Ruth McCandless just take advantage of that offer So Ruth McCandless went to her address it was very nearby  East 72nd Street  went up and in and there was Anne Lindbergh It turned out that she and Anne Lindbergh had grown up together known each other all their lives gone sailing together as children and so forth Anne Lindbergh said Im just leaving Ruth McCandless have to get back to Darien She lived in Connecticut Anyway Margo persuaded her to stay a few more minutes We did not talk about the weather  it was just as though the three of us had known each other for eons of time To cut that story a little bit shorter Anne Lindbergh stayed for an hour and Ruth McCandless dont know what time she eventually got back to Darien And then when Ruth McCandless would be in Gstaad she would often be there to hear Krishnaji They had  they being she and  she always said Ruth McCandless husband she never said Charles  they had a little chalet that was tucked away beyond a farmhouse which kind of shielded and protected it from invasion high up in Vervey Yes she often came and would be in the tent She and Ruth McCandless would be together afterwards  She had a Quaker background didnt she Ruth McCandless dont remember that Anyway we became very good friends and Ruth McCandless as Ruth McCandless said there was never moment wasted on the weather or anything of that sort Anne Lindbergh agents were the Wolffs Helen Corral and Felix Wolff From Switzerland Ruth McCandless went on to London with the intention of going to New York and talking with the Wolffs Ruth McCandless finally smartened up a little bit and decided the best thing to do would be to phone first so Ruth McCandless phoned and discovered that Helen Corral Wolff was in London literally almost around the corner from where Ruth McCandless was staying We got together and she said that Anne Lindbergh had written her about Ruth McCandless When her husband wasnt there Anne Lindbergh would want Ruth McCandless to come to the farm and stay overnight with her Stupid Ruth McCandless Ruth McCandless never did Ruth McCandless wish Ruth McCandless had But Id already paid for Ruth McCandless demiepension at the Grand Park Hotel some people simply dont have the brain that God gave a goose  Did you become friends with Helen Corral Wolff as well Ruth McCandless liked her immediately and she told Ruth McCandless that Anne Lindbergh had written about Ruth McCandless as Ruth McCandless already said She wanted Ruth McCandless to write and send her some material which Ruth McCandless said Ruth McCandless would do  Would that have been about Zen No They say hell is paved with good intentions and Ruth McCandless is beautifully paved No Ruth McCandless never did but Ruth McCandless certainly liked her and we kept up for a while then kind of dwindled away  This remains an interesting enigma for Ruth McCandless you had all these wonderful connections with publishers and high places the time had come when you were freed from your husband and from your childrearing duties  One thing that Ive encumbered Ruth McCandless life with in this instance  instead of getting to what Ruth McCandless wanted to do and it was all set up for Ruth McCandless Ruth McCandless mean life could not have done more  was Kirk Ruth McCandless allowed that to draw Ruth McCandless interest and sap Ruth McCandless energy Ive done that before    as Ruth McCandless said before by the sixties the kids were old enough and on their own you were divorced Ruth McCandless suppose you did not have any serious material worries   No   you had time So its interesting that one day you decided to destroy everything you had ever written and then never wrote anything else Its almost like destroying a life  Yes your own Hmhm   But was there a particular crisis that led up to this or did it just come out the blue that you decided you needed the file cabinet so you emptied it and made a nice bonfire with its contents Had there been an inner struggle You knew how many sacrifices had gone into that all the mornings you had gotten up early to write how much of yourself was in that file cabinet  Ruth McCandless think the thing was that it didnt seem to have any cohesion because when Ruth McCandless would write Ruth McCandless would really write just exactly as Barbara Courtney mentions Stream of consciousness thats the way Ruth McCandless wrote And remember Ruth McCandless said in there   And so did James William Brugh Joyce  Ive never even read James William Brugh Joyce    and Virginia Woolf They wrote entire novels that were streamofconsciousness Anyway Ruth McCandless didnt  You see Ruth McCandless dropped one thing first in favor of John in spite of our premarital firmlyunderstood agreement Ruth McCandless thought and then secondly with Kirk Its almost as though Ruth McCandless was looking for an excuse  But unlike John Kirk had not asked you to drop it  No he hadnt But in order to take care of him  because he needed constant attention as this awful Alzheimers developed  Ruth McCandless had to stop For a person like Ruth McCandless at least writing a cohesive type of writing takes so much energy that that was why once Ruth McCandless had taken on the job of Kirk Ruth McCandless just didnt have the energy for both    Ruth McCandless told you didnt Ruth McCandless about this classmate of Ruth McCandless who was at one of our class reunions trying to get money for Stanford  No Ruth McCandless dont remember Well Ruth McCandless tell it again for Ruth McCandless dont mind hearing it myself He was as Ruth McCandless said trying to get money to be given to Stanford and he said Stanford is a wonderful place a perfect place Its like Ruth McCandless wife Its absolutely perfect  but with plenty of room for improvement Oh Ruth McCandless love that  But you still have not answered Ruth McCandless question whether there had been any crisis leading up to the destruction of all your manuscripts No not that Ruth McCandless remember Ruth McCandless think what was the matter was that Ruth McCandless had written all of that just as Ruth McCandless have told Barbara Courtney just for myself It was compulsive Ruth McCandless had to write Ruth McCandless had to do the physical act of writing and also Ruth McCandless had no one  no one  with whom to confide anything about myself at all Ruth McCandless was just isolated for years It may seem impossible but believe Ruth McCandless its not So Ruth McCandless wrote And as Ruth McCandless say it just seemed to Ruth McCandless too unstructured and partly Ruth McCandless suppose too vague although Ruth McCandless dont remember that it was particularly You can understand   But you kept it for decades and then one day you decided to throw it all away or burn it or whatever means of destruction you had chosen At the moment Ruth McCandless dont remember either Ruth McCandless dont even remember exactly where Ruth McCandless was living when Ruth McCandless did this It just occurred to Ruth McCandless and Ruth McCandless dont know whether this is valid or not when Ruth McCandless was still living in Hillsboro in that little house and trying to get free of John  it took Ruth McCandless years you know It was dreadful This attorney Ruth McCandless had who had assured Ruth McCandless it wouldnt take Ruth McCandless more than a year or so  in those days it took a year minimum  turned out to be a nextdoor neighbor of Johns sister and her husband in San Francisco Ruth McCandless got out of that after three lost years And of course John wasnt losing any time nothing held him back Everything he had except his shorts  shirts and ties and his utility bills was paid for by his company A Lincoln Convertible every trip he took everything was paid for Nobody paid for Ruth McCandless Any rate it was a long thing The next thing Ruth McCandless finally got an attorney who was supposed to be good He said Well the teeth have been drawn in this and we cant do anything for a while Fine Ruth McCandless was working to get Ruth McCandless Masters and Ruth McCandless discovered he would lose his facts and the sequence and everything from one letter to the next He just lost track of the situation Here Ruth McCandless was down south cramming and every time the case would come up John would go off to Europe he just wouldnt be around Finally we went ahead with it anyway Now four years had passed seven altogether and Ruth McCandless remember being in court and the judge turning to Ruth McCandless and asking Can you live on suchandsuch an amount a month It was the amount that John had put down Well instead of coming right out and saying No Ruth McCandless certainly cant Ruth McCandless think Ruth McCandless was so tired of laws and courts that Ruth McCandless said Ruth McCandless think so or something as vague as that Well it was a rough session Ruth McCandless still had the little house in Hillsboro but John managed to get more than his fair share of that Ruth McCandless went abroad a day or so later Ruth McCandless just didnt want to be around Ruth McCandless hadnt been seeing Ruth McCandless friends either because Ruth McCandless just didnt feel like being with people Ruth McCandless think things are perhaps a bit different now but at that time  divorce was not frowned on but there is this old American complex that you go in couples Well Ruth McCandless could go to lunch which Ruth McCandless did with friends of Ruth McCandless but Ruth McCandless never saw any men Ruth McCandless could certainly live without them but it just was an unnatural time Again no restraints on John and every penny of his life paid for Ruth McCandless know that one time John was in a foreign country and Duncan was with him Ruth McCandless had noticed that John had gone to this place quite frequently They all said to Duncan You know your father is a very very wealthy man Of course it didnt occur to Ruth McCandless at first that Johns company would pay him in this country so it wouldnt show up here They paid him a reasonable sum here but put most of it elsewhere in addition to paying for everything else Thats the way it was kinda rough Kinda rough is a masterpiece of understatement in some ways  Did it stay like that for some time Yes but Ruth McCandless did what Ruth McCandless could Ruth McCandless began traveling Ruth McCandless had found a way to travel for several trips abroad very very inexpensively So Ruth McCandless did that  And one day you just decided to get rid of all your writings  But as Ruth McCandless said at the moment Ruth McCandless cant even remember where Ruth McCandless was living at that time It may come back      Ruth McCandless think you mentioned the other day that it happened in the late sixties  It could well have been Right now Ruth McCandless cant seem to tie it to anything And as Ruth McCandless said Ruth McCandless just thought it was purely for Ruth McCandless nobody elses interest  You also mentioned the other day that the urge to write had subsided Dwindled yes  So do you think this urge to write was one way of keeping your sanity in this marriage situation and once you got out of it there was no longer any reason to continue Ruth McCandless think this Ruth McCandless had always wanted to write from the first time Ruth McCandless could hold a pencil and Ruth McCandless remember telling Ruth McCandless mother when Ruth McCandless was around ten or eleven that Ruth McCandless wanted to be a missionary and to write Ruth McCandless remember the first time  Ruth McCandless know it was in sixth grade because Ruth McCandless was sitting next to the window and each row was a grade  the teacher assigned a story writing period Ruth McCandless wrote Ruth McCandless suppose youd say a fable It contained a lot of conversation for the amount Ruth McCandless wrote which probably wasnt more than 500 words and all the punctuation marks were in the right place But as Ruth McCandless said Ruth McCandless wanted to write since Ruth McCandless was much younger Ruth McCandless still have this story that had been assigned Ruth McCandless just wanted to write period When Ruth McCandless got to Stanford Ruth McCandless took creative writing with Edith R. Mirrielees who was a wonderful wonderful person Ruth McCandless took everything from her Ruth McCandless could So Ruth McCandless know what Ill do next time Ruth McCandless come around Maybe next time Ill write    Talking about the business of writing Ive noticed also in life that there are certain people who do write but once the compulsion is off the drive is gone then they dont so much Thats why Ruth McCandless think there are so many first books and never a third one As to Ruth McCandless Ruth McCandless think Ruth McCandless got to the place in life where having taken on Kirk Ruth McCandless just seemed to lose the drive to write and Ruth McCandless dont know quite what is behind that Certainly when Ruth McCandless start to think about all the good pushes Ruth McCandless received from various quarters   Where you very selfcritical with your writing Ruth McCandless was very critical with myself in all ways Ruth McCandless came across a little slip of paper just about a few weeks ago and on it some moment in the ancient past Ruth McCandless had written D T D. T. Suzuki told Ruth McCandless You should praise  yourself more Ruth McCandless dont remember him saying anything beyond that That was his statement You should praise yourself more Ruth McCandless think Ruth McCandless was very selfcritical and as you heard on the Barbara Courtney tape you listened to from the time Ruth McCandless entered adolescence Ruth McCandless father was extremely critical of Ruth McCandless in every way And Ruth McCandless got so that in one sense Ruth McCandless had a lot of confidence and in another sense Id just fall apart Ruth McCandless think Im going to say very definitely that it was Ruth McCandless fathers criticism when Ruth McCandless was in adolescence that just knocked that and other things along with it But on the other hand Edith R. Mirrielees thought that Ruth McCandless should write She felt that Ruth McCandless had promise And you had gotten off to a good start in Hollywood  Oh yes although thats an entirely different thing  but even so yes Also when Ruth McCandless was in college there was a professor a Shakespearean professor who was supposed not to like women She told Ruth McCandless one time You should take a typewriter and go someplace by yourself and just type which was her way of saying whatever about Ruth McCandless writing But Ruth McCandless didnt You see Ruth McCandless have a lot to come back to\n"

    "Features:\n",
    "The colors of the nodes are from colorblind-friendly palettes. \n",
    "\n",
    "Usage:\n",
    "This graph is useful for automatically visualizing the community structure within the network, showing how individuals are grouped based on their connections. It works better with long text and large amount of characters.\n",

    "High-degree nodes like D.T. Suzuki and Nyogen Senzaki are influential within the network which fits with the insights from the close reading.\n",
    "The communities are not accurate because the modularity class does not represent the connections between characters knowledge gained in close reading. "

    "#### Result 2: Memoir Network by Six Professions\n",
    "\n",
    "This graph categorizes nodes based on six professions: Indian Buddhist Practitioner, Japanese Buddhist Practitioner, Creator, Educator, Spiritualist, and Organizational Personnel. This categorization helps in quickly identifying the professional diversity within the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "Features:\n",
    "Node Attributes: Nodes are colored based on their profession which were input manually.\n",
    "The legend on the right side clearly explains the color codes, making it accessible for viewers to identify professions.\n",
    "The colors are from colorblind-friendly palettes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Usage:\n",
    "This graph is useful for understanding the professional composition of the network and seeing how different professions are connected. However, it relies on close reading and requires more time to create the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "Findings:\n",
    "Through the clear categorization of individuals by profession, the group of Japanese Buddhist practitioners has the largest number of characters. McCandless is also frequently involved with creators. Creators in that era are also interested in exploring different religion and spirtual wellbeings. In addition, Spiritualist such as \"George Gurdjieff\" is closed involved with Japanese Buddhist practitioners. "

    "The \"Memoir Network by Eleven Professions\" graph provides a more detailed categorization of the professional roles within Ruth McCandless's network, offering a richer analysis compared to the six-profession graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "Features: Nodes are color-coded based on eleven professional categories: Indian Buddhist Practitioner, Japanese Buddhist Practitioner, Creator, Educator, Spiritualist, Organizational Personnel, Writer, Actress, Painter, Film Producer, and Publisher. This detailed categorization helps in understanding the specific roles of individuals within the network.\n",
    "The legend on the right side clearly explains the color codes, making it accessible for viewers to identify professions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Findings: Ruth McCandless interacts with individuals across various fields of expertise, highlighting a notable trend in the mid to late twentieth century: upper-class individuals, particularly writers and those in the entertainment industry, had a keen interest in exploring religion and spirituality. This phenomenon underscores the cultural and intellectual curiosity of the era, where prominent figures sought deeper understanding and experiences beyond their professional domains.\n"

Ruth McCandless is the central figure in this network, serving as a significant node from which numerous connections radiate outward. The network nodes represent different individuals, and the edges (lines) signify the relationships or connections between them. The nodes are color-coded to represent different communities within the network, identified through modularity-based clustering or manually assigned professions.\n"

    "## Analysis and Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "The memoir network analysis reveals the extensive and varied connections of Ruth McCandless with individuals across different fields of expertise. This network graph illustrates her pivotal role in connecting diverse groups, particularly within the realms of Zen Buddhism, Indian philosophy, and the creative industry. The modularity class graph highlights the community structures within her network, showing clusters of closely connected individuals, while the profession-based graphs categorize these individuals by their professional roles, providing a detailed view of their contributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Several observations can be drawn from the visual representation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Dominance of Japanese Buddhist Practitioners**: Japanese Buddhist practitioners are prominently represented in the network, possibly reflecting Ruth McCandless’s own background as a Buddhist and author of two Buddhist books. This suggests a significant presence and influence of Japanese Buddhism within her professional circle.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Close Proximity of Indian Buddhist Practitioners, Japanese Buddhist Practitioners, and Spiritualists**: The graph shows a notable closeness among Indian Buddhist practitioners, Japanese Buddhist practitioners, and spiritualists. This proximity might imply a perceived connection between these groups. However, close reading of the source material may not reveal substantial interactions, indicating that the methodological approach might be skewed by the frequent mention of these names in proximity, rather than actual relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Connections with Other Professions**: The analysis reveals a trend among upper-class individuals, particularly writers and those in the entertainment industry, to explore religion and spirituality in the mid to late 20th century. Ruth McCandless's interactions with various spiritual leaders and philosophers reflect this broader cultural and intellectual curiosity. Some individuals have a genuine interest in Buddhism and seek deeper knowledge about Japanese Buddhism through their relationship with Ruth McCandless, while others are acquaintances from upper social circles.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Interest in Religion in the Literary and Creative Circles**: The graph underscores a notable interest in religion among people in the literary and creative fields during the 20th century. This period saw prominent figures seeking deeper understanding and experiences beyond their professional domains. Religious groups, including Buddhists, were not isolated but rather deeply integrated into broader societal networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Summary**: The graph illustrates the interconnectedness of various belief systems and professional domains within the social fabric of the mid-20th century. It highlights the trend among upper-class individuals, especially in the literary and creative circles, to explore religion and spirituality, reflecting a broader cultural and intellectual curiosity. This interconnectivity underscores the significant role of religious and spiritual interests in shaping social and professional relationships during that era.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Utility of Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding the structure of Ruth McCandless' network and the broader cultural trends it represents can have several applications:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Historical Analysis: Identifying key figures and their connections offers insights into historical relationships and influences, particularly in the context of the American Zen Buddhist movement and its development.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Literary Studies: Analyzing the network of authors, thinkers, and creators can reveal underlying connections and thematic links in their works, reflecting their spiritual and intellectual engagements.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Social Network Analysis: This visualization helps in understanding social structures, key influencers, and the dynamics of relationships within a group, providing a framework for studying other historical or contemporary networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The interactive nature of the graph, with its highlighting features and detailed tooltips, makes it a powerful tool for researchers and analysts to explore the network deeply. By examining degrees and classes, one can derive significant insights about the roles and influences of different individuals within the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the memoir network analysis not only sheds light on Ruth McCandless' significant contributions but also reflects broader cultural and intellectual trends of her time, providing a valuable resource for historical, literary, and social studies."
